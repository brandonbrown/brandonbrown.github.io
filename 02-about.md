	      <p>Well hi again, welcome to my fourth<em>(ish)</em> version of this site. This one is built with Jekyll, Sass, a sprinkling of JavaScript, and hosted on GitHub. I was considering Laravel and Wordpress but decided against them to keep this version focused on content creation rather than the temptations of a sandbox. I'm working on other projects to satisfy those feelings.</p>

			<p>I'm excited about technology and the near prophetical feelings of its absurdly fast advancements. We share in the guessing game of new ideas, whos-who lists, and trying to figure out just why ideas like Snapchat and Yo! really work. Our social dopamine values must be off the charts.</p>
			<p>It's a flipping ton of fun to teach research, design, and user-testing. The University atmosphere that Full Sail provides is the only place I could see myself teaching. Their support of degrees and classes that evolve on a near monthly basis is unequal.</p>

	      	<p>Central Florida is an area primed to make the leap to first-team play with San Francisco, New York City, and Seattle on tech and startup lists everywhere. It's exciting to be a part of this tight-knit community that will evolve so much over the next few years in this growing town.</p>
