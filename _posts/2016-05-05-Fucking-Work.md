## Damn Social Media

What a damn time suck social media can be. Over the years I've allowed way too much time to be wasted away, getting that next dopamine hit from seeing some bullshit I don't care about put into the web by someone I'm not sure I really cared to see it from. Enter [gofuckingwork.com](https://www.gofuckingwork.com/).

Gofuckingwork is a chrome extension that allows you to block sites easily in chrome, with options to how easy it is to disable. It's been a big productivity booster for myself, and I have a feeling a few of you out there could use it, too.

Now get back to work, you fuck.
