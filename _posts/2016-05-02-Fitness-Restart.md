## How I Chose My New Workout Routine

There is so much, too much, health and fitness information spread about the internet today. I've collected, read, and have made both good and bad decisions based on all of the material. Before you dive into reading my addition to all of that fitness fodder information, keep in mind that the best thing you can do for yourself is research, talk, and hear as many differing view points about these things. Just like getting a second opinion from a doctor, don't make fitness decisions off of what one guy on the internet said. Each of us have different goals, different bodies, and different lives. What works for me may not necessarily work for you, but you can learn from it!

#### Where I'm (re)Starting From

Stagnation. These past 12 months have been the lightest in physicality I've experienced since learning to walk. On top of a general lack of doing, this past year has been financially, mentally, and level-of-fucks-to-care draining. One sun rotation ago I was at 195lbs standing 6'3" with a deadlift of 230lbs and a squat of 250lbs. I was feeling great.

My nutrition has been horrendous as well. It's worse to eat horribly when you know what you're doing to your body. I've avoided fast food like McDonalds for years, but now I've got a pretty solid Monopoly piece collection going. Anyone out there have a Broadway they want to split with me? My approach to nutrition will be covered in a separate article for clarity and brevity.

So this all adds up to me needing a fix. A daily feeling of putting on a shirt and not looking at myself in the mirror, for I know the burst of depression that will bring on. Luckily, I not only have years of experience lifting, but I also have a strong network of people in a wide spread of professional health and fitness roles in my life. The people I know are past bodybuilders, athletic trainers, doctors, nurses, nutritionists, and lifestyle coaches. It's amazing that I've allowed myself to fall so far, when all I needed to do was ask for help.

#### Where I Want To Be

First, I want to enjoy a healthy lifestyle again. Keeping active physically and mentally. This means not making passive choices and going with the flow- my biggest fight right now. Every choice will be made with purpose and followed through with tenacity and full backing of myself. If I can achieve this mindset, everything that comes along as a result will feel like a bonus.

To achieve this mindset once more, I know I need to see and feel results. From my past experiences, this means diving back into a powerlifting routine. Well, I'm not sure my body could handle that beating quite yet. I want to set a foundation of lighter exercises for the first month, to get my body and mind into the routines of exercising, eating, and sleeping in the ways it will need to once more. Once this foundation is achieved, I will be set up to give a routine such as the classic Stronglifts, Ice Cream Fitness, or Starting Strength a go.

Gym time is for weight lifting. I simply hate the idea of standing in a room, in one spot, for anymore than 5 minutes doing cardio. I live in beautiful and sunny Florida- I'll take my cardio outside. Rather than only running, I will be bringing Soccer and Golf back into my life. These are the opposite ends of the cardio spectrum which are both needed for a full, healthy body. Soccer is the easy one to understand, because there's running involved- but golf? Golf is a sport of focus, concentration, and control. Lining up a tee-shot is much different than staring down an 8-foot putt. In even the highest level of competition you can't line up heart racing, adrenaline pumping. You must learn to control your body's reactions, which is a huge part of testing your cardiovascular system. I'll be keeping Golf and Soccer in mind as I create my routine.

I just finished the [audiobook Zen Golf: Mastering the Mental Game by Dr. Joseph Parent](http://amzn.to/1rsoSCA) <span class="affiliate">Amazon Affiliate</span> and learned an absolute ton on the subject of focus. Can't wait to share more of that with you.

#### What I'm Doing To Get There

The most helpful advice I can give when picking a routine, is pick one you'll stick with. It has to work with you, on your terms, otherwise you're setting yourself up for failure before you've put on your gym shorts. My personal best solution right now will be a workout that will last about one hour in the afternoon, three days a week. Also something simple and flexible. Flexible in movements that can be added or changed depending on the crowd at the gym. I have a little over an hour to get to the gym, get in my workout, and clean up post workout. Sometimes to get a full routine in at a busy gym I'll need a few options. Starting simple will help with that. Last thing is understanding that this is a foundational routine, preparing my body for the scaling up of intensity in 4 weeks. This means more reps per set with a slow increase of weight each workout. This foundation is not about adding a ton of weight on the bar fast, but telling all my muscles it's time to do work again. Rep ranges in the 8-12 range will be best for this.


#### The Routine

So let's break this down quick. This routine will be based on:

- 3 Days a week
- 4 week duration
- 1 hour sessions (max)
- Medium to High rep ranges

##### Day 1: Legs

##### Day 2: Chest and Triceps

| Exercise | Sets X Reps | Details |

| Side Dumbbell Raise | 3 x 8 | |
| Reverse Flyes | 3 x 8 | |
| Medicine Ball Rollouts | 3 X F | |
| Leg Raises | 3 x 12 | |

#### Wrap Up

This looks like a plan. Each day starts with a small warm up that's goal is to get the muscles moving and heart rate up without exhausting energy levels. Also, each day wraps with a supporting abdominal focused workout which is key to creating a strong foundation to build on later. Every move is somehow supported by the abdominal region, so an early focus will be extremely helpful in making progressive gains while avoiding injury setbacks. I can't wait to get started up again. My intake is looking good to support the beginning of this new workout routine, and the aches and pains of sitting around far too much are about to be demolished.
