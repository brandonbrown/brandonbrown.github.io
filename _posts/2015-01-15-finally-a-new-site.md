This is version 4. 

Back in December of 2014, in the midst of an upheavel of my professional, personal lives I had the added benefit of a site hacking. This prompted a response from me to simply tear down the site. I'm happy I did.

The site had been sitting there for years while my skills shifted from pure designer, to designer-developer, then to User Experience Design. This site is built to focus on what I've always wanted from a personal site: Sharing my thoughts and experiences and how I like to relate it all back to my design processes.
