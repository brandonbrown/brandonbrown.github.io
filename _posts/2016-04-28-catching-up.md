## Hey Rocko, Thanks

My god, I actually have a site - I should really get this updated more often. Things are starting to find their groove after a year filled with a ton of change. For starters, surgery. I had been putting off gall-bladder removal for nearly a decade and I'm happy to say it's all finally been taken care of. Second, I moved in with my wonderful girlfriend and her little ones the day I left the hospital after the previously mentioned surgery. It's been a giant adaptation living with a small family, but a wonderful shift. Third, I've started to actively develop and teach development again. That has been the biggest struggle, with some huge wins and equally giant failures along the way. React Native and Javascript have taken their tolls on me the past 8 months, but finally the light at the end of the tunnel is discernable from the darkness.

Then a gut check came down - hard. The passing of my grandfather drastically changed my outlook on moving forward. There are fewer moments in life stronger than death in their power of reflection. Mourning with family, some of whom I haven't seen in nearly 8 years, brought with it the expected sorrows, sobbings, long embraces, and many dispensed tissues. The thing is though, my family sent our loved Pop off in the fashion he would have loved most- with us all together sharing hysterical stories, obnoxious laughter, loud conversation, warm welcoming arms, and dampened shoulders everywhere. We had a party, fitting for the man who seemed to live as though he was always the host of the best party in town. Pop was known for his joyous demeanor. Always the joke cracker, always one to bring a flood of smiles to the room. If you were a familiar face he'd forgotten the name to, you were Rocko, or Charlie- and you were okay with it. He loved to show off his ability to dive through an inner-tube (still did into his later years) and always invited the kids to push him into the pool while he was looking for a quarter at the bottom. 

This will be the way I remember him. Through laughter. Through wise-cracks. Through a sense of letting go of work and the seriousness I've carried along with it for far too long. There will be more joy in the world around me because of my Pop. Thanks Rocko.

#### Apathy, My Old Friend

There was another lesson I took from Pop's passing. As I remembered him, I turned and looked at myself as well. Something I've realized is the biggest hurdle I've faced for nearly half my life has been a show stopping, career altering, life changing amount of apathy. I'm not sure where it all came from. I can pinpoint the day this feeling first came over me. It was the spring of my Freshman year of highschool, after leaving my baseball team's practice and I had a feeling of - nothing. It's been that way for almost 15 years now. Sure there have been moments where I felt passion, drive, belief, happiness- but this sense of indetermination always found a way back. Life has been focused on today, always stressed about the what ifs, the why-did-that-happens, and lack of connection with the consequences of inaction. I'm thankful for having this realization at a time in my life when large change is still possible.

### Do Something

To begin what I see as the first of many healthy steps, I've added a simple daily habit to my routine. This is something I think everyone should begin doing and is the reason I've written a more personal post. Each day, I've slotted 15 minutes to ponder on "What could I be doing to make myself happy?" What I've done is added directly to my calendar a 15-minute time slot that means to stop what I'm thinking about and check for something I'm doing that will bring happiness directly into my life. Whatever those thoughts are give me a barometer into my actions to the future. For instance, I've noticed a lot of joy coming to my life with the reignited passion for soccer that my supporting of Manchester United. To keep this source of joy, I make sure to block out the times around their matches and discuss the outcomes with friends and other soccer fans around me. It's a small thing, but something I had let fall from my life through inaction and stagnation.

Since adding small items into my life that are more about me, I've noticed a change not only in my attitude but in that of those around me. There's something about someone who's passionate and eager to enjoy something that people are drawn to. That they're excited to be around. For example, I don't openly exclaim that I'm a Manchester United fan in public, however when the topic does come up, the added social bonding and sense of belonging that comes with supporting team sports has been a great added bonus. Even with the current season United have been getting on with. 

Sports have always been an important area of bonding for my family. Some of the best memories I've had with them are centered around the New York Yankees, the New York Jets and Giants, and playing golf. The Master's was recently played, and it was one of the first I sat and watched in quite a while. My younger brother and I were chatting throughout the days more than we had in years past. It was fanstatic. Sorry, Spieth. Golf has a great way of humbling you, giving you focus, and offering time spent with people you may not get to otherwise. As part of my initiative to slow down and to turn off always-in-work-mode, I'm going to bring golf back into view. I think it'll be tough for family to turn down an invitation to visit Florida for a few rounds.

Thanks, Pop. I wish we had time for one more joke, but you're still bringing joy to my life each day. Hope you'll like what you see happening down here.
