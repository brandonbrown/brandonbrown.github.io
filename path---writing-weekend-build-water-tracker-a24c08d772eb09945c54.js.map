You should be able to see the interface in its most recent state above.</p>\\n<p>Okay, let‚Äôs go:</p>\\n<p>First, let‚Äôs make sure Expo is up to date. Also handy if you haven‚Äôt installed Expo for react native yet:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-text\\\"><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">$ npm install -g expo-cli</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>For more info, visit the official <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started\\\">React Native docs</a></p>\\n<p>Now, let‚Äôs start the project:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-text\\\"><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">$ expo init MinMaxHydrate</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>I decided on the blank workflow with Yarn as my dependency tool.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-text\\\"><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">$ cd MinMaxHydrate &amp;&amp; yarn start</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Late addition to scope (our favorite!) of having teams in the mix. It‚Äôs a bold plan, let‚Äôs see if it plays out.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Now that we have our foundation, let‚Äôs add some structure:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<p>app</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>actions</li>\\n<li>assets</li>\\n<li>fonts</li>\\n<li>icons</li>\\n<li>images</li>\\n<li>components</li>\\n<li>config</li>\\n<li>modules</li>\\n<li>reducers</li>\\n<li>services</li>\\n<li>store</li>\\n<li>views</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Oh and of course, we should be tracking with <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">git</code></p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-text\\\"><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">git init</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>I‚Äôll keep the rest of the git steps out of this, but just a reminder for anyone who may follow this!</p>\\n<p>Since this is a UI focused workflow at the moment, one of the first things I want to do is create a global stylesheet.</p>\\n<p>Let‚Äôs create another directory under <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">assets</code> called <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">styles</code>. I‚Äôll create <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">global.js</code> within this directory.</p>\\n<p>I‚Äôm going to structure this file into sections that will help to clarify the purpose of the styles. For example:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-text\\\"><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">import { StyleSheet } from &#39;react-native&#39;\\n\\nconst layout = StyleSheet.create({   \\n  container: {                       \\n    marginTop: 150,\\n    backgroundColor: &#39;#ededed&#39;,\\n    flexWrap: &#39;wrap&#39;\\n  }\\n})\\n\\nconst buttons = StyleSheet.create({  \\n  primary: {                         \\n    flex: 1,\\n    height: 70,\\n    backgroundColor: &#39;red&#39;,\\n    justifyContent: &#39;center&#39;,\\n    alignItems: &#39;center&#39;,\\n    marginLeft: 20,\\n    marginRight: 20\\n  }\\n})\\n\\nexport { layout, buttons }   </code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>In this example, every style that assists in layout will be contained within the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">const layout</code> and styles for buttons will be contained to <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">const buttons</code>. Repeat as necessary.</p>\\n<p>Let‚Äôs move the contents of <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">App.js</code> into a better location. This will be <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">/app/views/Main.js</code>.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-text\\\"><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">App.js\\n\\nimport React from &#39;react&#39;;\\nimport Main from &#39;./app/views/Main&#39;\\n\\nexport default function App() {\\n  return (\\n    &lt;Main /&gt;\\n  );\\n};</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-text\\\"><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">Main.js\\n\\nimport React from &#39;react&#39;;\\nimport { Text, View } from &#39;react-native&#39;;\\n\\nexport default function Main() {\\n  return (\\n    &lt;View&gt;\\n      &lt;Text&gt;Open up App.js to start working on your app!&lt;/Text&gt;\\n    &lt;/View&gt;\\n  );\\n};</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>Great! Everything in our simulator should be nearly identical to how it was before! This move is going to be useful when we begin to add state management and routing into the application. More on routing soon.</p>\\n<p>Okay, back to the matter at hand, styles. Let‚Äôs start with colors. Keeping colors consistent throughout the UI is critical, let‚Äôs set up some variables to help us with this:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-text\\\"><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">global.js\\n\\nconst colors = {\\n    darkBlue: &#39;#0A1C3F&#39;,\\n    midBlue: &#39;#227BCE&#39;,\\n    brightBlue: &#39;#59AFFF&#39;,\\n    grayBlue: &#39;#18294A&#39;,\\n    yellow: &#39;#E5D969&#39;,\\n};\\n\\nconst layout = StyleSheet.create({   \\n  container: {                       \\n    backgroundColor: colors.brightBlue,\\n    flex: 1,\\n    flexWrap: &#39;wrap&#39;\\n  }\\n})</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<h3>Hol‚Äô up</h3>\\n<p>I didn‚Äôt set out to make this a tutorial, but an example of my thought process and a record of me creating an application. This is going to be where jumps begin to happen.</p>\\n<p>One jump is figuring out the swipe to show/hide the information behind the main entry form. <a href=\\\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/rn-bottom-drawer\\\">This looks promising to solve this</a>.</p>\\n<h3>New Thing!</h3>\\n<p>I‚Äôve never forked an NPM package to use in a custom way within a project, this is how to do just that:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Fork the original repo</li>\\n<li>Remove original package from project</li>\\n<li>In <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">package.json</code>, add the dependency with repo of your new package. For example, mine is now: <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">&quot;rn-bottom-drawer&quot;: &quot;https://github.com/brandonbrown/rn-bottom-drawer.git&quot;,</code></li>\\n<li>I also ran <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">$ yarn add https://github.com/brandonbrown/rn-bottom-drawer.git</code></li>\\n<li>In <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">package.json</code> of the npm module I removed <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">react</code> and <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">react-native</code> from <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">devDependencies</code> due to a name collision with libraries.</li>\\n<li>Run <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">yarn</code> and <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">yarn start</code> and we‚Äôre back in business with our own version of the module</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>All of that so I can control the width, but also not lose the work in the case I need to pull the project back down and reinstall the dependencies.</p>\\n<h3>Sliding</h3>\\n<p>Let‚Äôs add the ability to swipe the stats behind the main form card. I‚Äôll add this package to handle this: <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">$ yarn add react-native-swiper@nightly</code></p>\\n<p>I quickly added the package to my <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">Main.js</code> to test if it brings the correct capabilities.. and it did. That was too easy. Should I be worried?</p>\\n<p>Here is how this file looks right now:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-text\\\"><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">Main.js\\n\\nimport React from &#39;react&#39;;\\nimport { Dimensions, StyleSheet, Text, View  } from &#39;react-native&#39;;\\nimport { layout, buttons, card } from &#39;../assets/styles/global&#39;\\nimport Card from &#39;./Card&#39;\\n\\nimport Swiper from &#39;react-native-swiper&#39;\\n\\nexport default function Main() {\\n\\n  return (\\n    &lt;View style={layout.container}&gt;\\n      &lt;View style={layout.header}&gt;\\n        &lt;Text&gt;Profile&lt;/Text&gt;\\n        &lt;View style={layout.navigation}&gt;\\n            &lt;Text&gt;Teams&lt;/Text&gt;\\n            &lt;Text&gt;Tracker&lt;/Text&gt;\\n            &lt;Text&gt;Favorites&lt;/Text&gt;\\n            &lt;Text&gt;Settings&lt;/Text&gt;\\n        &lt;/View&gt;\\n      &lt;/View&gt;\\n\\n      &lt;View style={layout.content}&gt;\\n        &lt;Swiper\\n          style={styles.wrapper}\\n          loop={false}\\n          showsButtons={false}&gt;\\n          &lt;View style={styles.slide1}&gt;\\n            &lt;Text style={styles.text}&gt;Hello Swiper&lt;/Text&gt;\\n          &lt;/View&gt;\\n          &lt;View style={styles.slide2}&gt;\\n            &lt;Text style={styles.text}&gt;Beautiful&lt;/Text&gt;\\n          &lt;/View&gt;\\n          &lt;View style={styles.slide3}&gt;\\n            &lt;Text style={styles.text}&gt;And simple&lt;/Text&gt;\\n          &lt;/View&gt;\\n        &lt;/Swiper&gt;\\n      &lt;/View&gt;\\n      &lt;Card /&gt;\\n\\n    &lt;/View&gt;\\n  );\\n};\\n\\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\\n  wrapper: {},\\n  slide1: {\\n    flex: 1,\\n    justifyContent: &#39;center&#39;,\\n    alignItems: &#39;center&#39;,\\n    backgroundColor: &#39;#9DD6EB&#39;\\n  },\\n  slide2: {\\n    flex: 1,\\n    justifyContent: &#39;center&#39;,\\n    alignItems: &#39;center&#39;,\\n    backgroundColor: &#39;#97CAE5&#39;\\n  },\\n  slide3: {\\n    flex: 1,\\n    justifyContent: &#39;center&#39;,\\n    alignItems: &#39;center&#39;,\\n    backgroundColor: &#39;#92BBD9&#39;\\n  },\\n  text: {\\n    color: &#39;#fff&#39;,\\n    fontSize: 30,\\n    fontWeight: &#39;bold&#39;\\n  }\\n})</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>Yeah that was <em>incredibly</em> easy.</p>\\n<p>Well, onto something else. Let‚Äôs bring some charts into this. I‚Äôm a big fan of <a href=\\\"https://formidable.com/open-source/victory/docs/victory-chart/\\\">Victory Charts</a> and most likely will use them, but I‚Äôll do a quick look to see if any new alternatives have shown up.</p>\\n<p>This looks promising: <a href=\\\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-chart-kit\\\">React Native Chart Kit</a>\\nI really like the contribution graph, I may install this and see how far you can push it.</p>\\n<p><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">$ yarn add react-native-chart-kit</code>\\n<code class=\\\"language-text\\\">$ yarn add react-native-svg prop-types</code></p>\\n<p>This also needs a few adjustments to handle the styling I‚Äôm after. I also just learned that contributions don‚Äôt count in forks unless merged into the parent repo. I‚Äôd like to track my work, so <a href=\\\"https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/duplicating-a-repository\\\">duplicating the repo</a> may be necessary.

Also handy if you haven‚Äôt installed Expo for react native yet:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-text\\\"><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">$ npm install -g expo-cli</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>For more info, visit the official <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started\\\">React Native docs</a></p>\\n<p>Now, let‚Äôs start the project:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-text\\\"><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">$ expo init MinMaxHydrate</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>I decided on the blank workflow with Yarn as my dependency tool.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-text\\\"><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">$ cd MinMaxHydrate &amp;&amp; yarn start</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Late addition to scope (our favorite!) of having teams in the mix. It‚Äôs a bold plan, let‚Äôs see if it plays out.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Now that we have our foundation, let‚Äôs add some structure:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<p>app</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>actions</li>\\n<li>assets</li>\\n<li>fonts</li>\\n<li>icons</li>\\n<li>images</li>\\n<li>components</li>\\n<li>config</li>\\n<li>modules</li>\\n<li>reducers</li>\\n<li>services</li>\\n<li>store</li>\\n<li>views</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Oh and of course, we should be tracking with <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">git</code></p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-text\\\"><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">git init</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>I‚Äôll keep the rest of the git steps out of this, but just a reminder for anyone who may follow this!</p>\\n<p>Since this is a UI focused workflow at the moment, one of the first things I want to do is create a global stylesheet.</p>\\n<p>Let‚Äôs create another directory under <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">assets</code> called <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">styles</code>. I‚Äôll create <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">global.js</code> within this directory.</p>\\n<p>I‚Äôm going to structure this file into sections that will help to clarify the purpose of the styles. For example:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-text\\\"><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">import { StyleSheet } from &#39;react-native&#39;\\n\\nconst layout = StyleSheet.create({   \\n  container: {                       \\n    marginTop: 150,\\n    backgroundColor: &#39;#ededed&#39;,\\n    flexWrap: &#39;wrap&#39;\\n  }\\n})\\n\\nconst buttons = StyleSheet.create({  \\n  primary: {                         \\n    flex: 1,\\n    height: 70,\\n    backgroundColor: &#39;red&#39;,\\n    justifyContent: &#39;center&#39;,\\n    alignItems: &#39;center&#39;,\\n    marginLeft: 20,\\n    marginRight: 20\\n  }\\n})\\n\\nexport { layout, buttons }   </code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>In this example, every style that assists in layout will be contained within the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">const layout</code> and styles for buttons will be contained to <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">const buttons</code>. Repeat as necessary.</p>\\n<p>Let‚Äôs move the contents of <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">App.js</code> into a better location. This will be <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">/app/views/Main.js</code>.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-text\\\"><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">App.js\\n\\nimport React from &#39;react&#39;;\\nimport Main from &#39;./app/views/Main&#39;\\n\\nexport default function App() {\\n  return (\\n    &lt;Main /&gt;\\n  );\\n};</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-text\\\"><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">Main.js\\n\\nimport React from &#39;react&#39;;\\nimport { Text, View } from &#39;react-native&#39;;\\n\\nexport default function Main() {\\n  return (\\n    &lt;View&gt;\\n      &lt;Text&gt;Open up App.js to start working on your app!&lt;/Text&gt;\\n    &lt;/View&gt;\\n  );\\n};</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>Great! Everything in our simulator should be nearly identical to how it was before! This move is going to be useful when we begin to add state management and routing into the application. More on routing soon.</p>\\n<p>Okay, back to the matter at hand, styles. Let‚Äôs start with colors. Keeping colors consistent throughout the UI is critical, let‚Äôs set up some variables to help us with this:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-text\\\"><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">global.js\\n\\nconst colors = {\\n    darkBlue: &#39;#0A1C3F&#39;,\\n    midBlue: &#39;#227BCE&#39;,\\n    brightBlue: &#39;#59AFFF&#39;,\\n    grayBlue: &#39;#18294A&#39;,\\n    yellow: &#39;#E5D969&#39;,\\n};\\n\\nconst layout = StyleSheet.create({   \\n  container: {                       \\n    backgroundColor: colors.brightBlue,\\n    flex: 1,\\n    flexWrap: &#39;wrap&#39;\\n  }\\n})</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<h3>Hol‚Äô up</h3>\\n<p>I didn‚Äôt set out to make this a tutorial, but an example of my thought process and a record of me creating an application. This is going to be where jumps begin to happen.</p>\\n<p>One jump is figuring out the swipe to show/hide the information behind the main entry form. <a href=\\\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/rn-bottom-drawer\\\">This looks promising to solve this</a>.</p>\\n<h3>New Thing!</h3>\\n<p>I‚Äôve never forked an NPM package to use in a custom way within a project, this is how to do just that:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Fork the original repo</li>\\n<li>Remove original package from project</li>\\n<li>In <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">package.json</code>, add the dependency with repo of your new package. For example, mine is now: <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">&quot;rn-bottom-drawer&quot;: &quot;https://github.com/brandonbrown/rn-bottom-drawer.git&quot;,</code></li>\\n<li>I also ran <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">$ yarn add https://github.com/brandonbrown/rn-bottom-drawer.git</code></li>\\n<li>In <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">package.json</code> of the npm module I removed <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">react</code> and <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">react-native</code> from <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">devDependencies</code> due to a name collision with libraries.</li>\\n<li>Run <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">yarn</code> and <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">yarn start</code> and we‚Äôre back in business with our own version of the module</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>All of that so I can control the width, but also not lose the work in the case I need to pull the project back down and reinstall the dependencies.</p>\\n<h3>Sliding</h3>\\n<p>Let‚Äôs add the ability to swipe the stats behind the main form card. I‚Äôll add this package to handle this: <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">$ yarn add react-native-swiper@nightly</code></p>\\n<p>I quickly added the package to my <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">Main.js</code> to test if it brings the correct capabilities.. and it did. That was too easy. Should I be worried?</p>\\n<p>Here is how this file looks right now:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-text\\\"><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">Main.js\\n\\nimport React from &#39;react&#39;;\\nimport { Dimensions, StyleSheet, Text, View  } from &#39;react-native&#39;;\\nimport { layout, buttons, card } from &#39;../assets/styles/global&#39;\\nimport Card from &#39;./Card&#39;\\n\\nimport Swiper from &#39;react-native-swiper&#39;\\n\\nexport default function Main() {\\n\\n  return (\\n    &lt;View style={layout.container}&gt;\\n      &lt;View style={layout.header}&gt;\\n        &lt;Text&gt;Profile&lt;/Text&gt;\\n        &lt;View style={layout.navigation}&gt;\\n            &lt;Text&gt;Teams&lt;/Text&gt;\\n            &lt;Text&gt;Tracker&lt;/Text&gt;\\n            &lt;Text&gt;Favorites&lt;/Text&gt;\\n            &lt;Text&gt;Settings&lt;/Text&gt;\\n        &lt;/View&gt;\\n      &lt;/View&gt;\\n\\n      &lt;View style={layout.content}&gt;\\n        &lt;Swiper\\n          style={styles.wrapper}\\n          loop={false}\\n          showsButtons={false}&gt;\\n          &lt;View style={styles.slide1}&gt;\\n            &lt;Text style={styles.text}&gt;Hello Swiper&lt;/Text&gt;\\n          &lt;/View&gt;\\n          &lt;View style={styles.slide2}&gt;\\n            &lt;Text style={styles.text}&gt;Beautiful&lt;/Text&gt;\\n          &lt;/View&gt;\\n          &lt;View style={styles.slide3}&gt;\\n            &lt;Text style={styles.text}&gt;And simple&lt;/Text&gt;\\n          &lt;/View&gt;\\n        &lt;/Swiper&gt;\\n      &lt;/View&gt;\\n      &lt;Card /&gt;\\n\\n    &lt;/View&gt;\\n  );\\n};\\n\\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\\n  wrapper: {},\\n  slide1: {\\n    flex: 1,\\n    justifyContent: &#39;center&#39;,\\n    alignItems: &#39;center&#39;,\\n    backgroundColor: &#39;#9DD6EB&#39;\\n  },\\n  slide2: {\\n    flex: 1,\\n    justifyContent: &#39;center&#39;,\\n    alignItems: &#39;center&#39;,\\n    backgroundColor: &#39;#97CAE5&#39;\\n  },\\n  slide3: {\\n    flex: 1,\\n    justifyContent: &#39;center&#39;,\\n    alignItems: &#39;center&#39;,\\n    backgroundColor: &#39;#92BBD9&#39;\\n  },\\n  text: {\\n    color: &#39;#fff&#39;,\\n    fontSize: 30,\\n    fontWeight: &#39;bold&#39;\\n  }\\n})</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>Yeah that was <em>incredibly</em> easy.</p>\\n<p>Well, onto something else. Let‚Äôs bring some charts into this. I‚Äôm a big fan of <a href=\\\"https://formidable.com/open-source/victory/docs/victory-chart/\\\">Victory Charts</a> and most likely will use them, but I‚Äôll do a quick look to see if any new alternatives have shown up.</p>\\n<p>This looks promising: <a href=\\\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-chart-kit\\\">React Native Chart Kit</a>\\nI really like the contribution graph, I may install this and see how far you can push it.</p>\\n<p><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">$ yarn add react-native-chart-kit</code>\\n<code class=\\\"language-text\\\">$ yarn add react-native-svg prop-types</code></p>\\n<p>This also needs a few adjustments to handle the styling I‚Äôm after. I also just learned that contributions don‚Äôt count in forks unless merged into the parent repo. I‚Äôd like to track my work, so <a href=\\\"https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/duplicating-a-repository\\\">duplicating the repo</a> may be necessary. I may add the contributions into the parent in the future.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Also, holding a new born slows the typing and the brain equally</p>\\n</blockquote>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"Weekend Build: Water Tracker UI\",\"date\":\"November 23, 2019\",\"category\":\"Development\"}}},\"pathContext\":{\"slug\":\"/writing/weekend-build-water-tracker/\",\"previous\":{\"fields\":{\"slug\":\"/writing/bookmarks-7/\"},\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"BKMKS7 Nov 17 2019\",\"category\":\"Resources\"}},\"next\":{\"fields\":{\"slug\":\"/writing/bookmarks-8/\"},\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"BKMKS8 Nov 24 2019\",\"category\":\"Resources\"}}}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/json-loader!./.cache/json/writing-weekend-build-water-tracker.json\n// module id = 400\n// module chunks = 71906251609360"],"sourceRoot":""}
