      <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.</p>

      <p class="teacher">The web and tech industries have grown exponentially because we all take on the role of mentor at some point. Never before have we seen an industry where not only individuals but companies, organizations, and even governments see the impact sharing knowledge can have in lifting us all. I'm lucky enough to have made this my day job. Full Sail University offers me the ability to teach the quickly &amp; constantly evolving practice of Mobile Design to the very best talents emerging from higher-education. It's the best job I've ever had.</p>

      <p class="photographer">Photography has been a deep well of inspiration for me over the years. Much of my visual design language came from studying photography and movies. This inspiration has turned to craft with a focus on post-process supported imagery of cosplayers. I help people become the superheroes they've always wanted to be.</p>

      <p class="designer">Designing applications that help people to achieve goals, help to make their day a bit easier, or to give them a chance to take a light-hearted break is an amazing way to make a career. I'm currently developing a few projects to do all of these things in areas I'm personally interested in. These include connecting people, maintaining a fun &amp; healthy lifestyle, and laughing along with cats.</p>

      <p class="fitness">A healthy mind needs a healthy body. Health &amp; fitness have been a driving force through my life. After years of experimenting with different routines, diets, and learning from different set backs, I've acrued a massive amount of information that I base all my fitness choices on. </p>

      <p class="youCompleteMe">Ocassionally, there will be a brain dump of random topic here. For example you may see me venting about a Manchester United missed opportunity, the difficulty of deciding which V8 powered pick-up truck I'll purchase, the next area of physics I'm trying to wrap my head around, and why the Mass Effect series is my favorite video game universe since my addiction to Stargate needs another space exploration fix.</p>
