I obsessively watch YouTube videos on a breath of topics, religiously listen to podcasts that go deep into areas I didn’t know could be so interesting, and I will do everything I can to support the people that make this all possible.</p>\n<p>Much of what I write about is a self-targeted sense of improvement. My main focus at this time is a physical improvement. My body needs to regain a sense of proper functioning, giving it the ability to support other areas of my life. I wrote the other day about a World Cup inspired workout, but I decided to rethink my real goals. I need to form a strong base. One that targeted, functional programming can benefit off of. I went back to an old resource for fitness information, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe0TLA0EsQbE-MjuHXevj2A">Jeff Cavaliere</a>.</p>\n<p>Jeff runs a Youtube Channel devoted to sharing information. He does sell programs, supplements, shirts, and other items at his website <a href="https://athleanx.com">https://athleanx.com</a>. However, he himself has said you don’t need to buy his programs to be successful. He shares it all on his YouTube channel and does a great job of communicating in a way you can trust him. I went and purchased his Max Size 90-day program because of his honest, truthful, and giving approach.</p>\n<p>Day 1 is Monday, July 16 day 90 will be October 14. I’m going to share my experience and progress along the way both here and potentially in other places.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Athlean-X and Supporting The Honest Givers",date:"July 13, 2018",category:"Fitness"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/writing/athleanx/",category:"Fitness",previous:{fields:{slug:"/writing/coffee-and-success/"},frontmatter:{title:"Coffee and Success",category:"Motivation",posttype:"writing"}},next:{fields:{slug:"/writing/personal-training/"},frontmatter:{title:"Studying the Human Body",category:"Fitness",posttype:"writing"}}}}}});
