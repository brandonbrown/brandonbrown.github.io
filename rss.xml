They teach us more about ourselves than we could have ever presumed they could. I’ve been repeating a simple commentary to many enthusiastic but quietly disheartened early designers for a decade when asked to critique their self-branding. “You are your toughest client.” Websites, logos, flyers, business cards, resumes, and apps. Anything they’re developing to show the world why they’re different and better than their professional competition. All the while thinking that this self-directed branding will be what shapes their careers for the next 40 years. It’s commonly an enjoyable, sometimes uncomfortable discussion, but obviously necessary to their growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discussion normally yields questions in the shape of “Who do you want to work with in the future,” “Where do you want to live and work in 10 years,” and “Why did you start down this career path” amongst other pointed directives. Yet, here I am, astonished at the fact I never considered to take the challenge of this thought process a giant step further: Why not design your life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Toughest Client You Will Ever Have&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working in an area of design for even a small amount of time, you will find that there are processes and guidelines for finding a solution or working with people that are not sure what they’re after. These standardized steps help to keep businesses moving efficiently and help to make the designer seem less like a magician and more like an architect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are different processes for various areas of design, diverse types of people and companies, and enough to fit a variety of timelines and budgets. A favorite of mine, which I’ve been fortunate to be able to research, teach, and employ for years is the Design Sprint. This process is what I’ll be working to implement directed and meaningful transformation in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Design Sprint’s power is wielded through two main factors: Iteration and Understanding. To use it effectively in the design profession, we rely on research and user interviews to attain understanding while creating disposable prototypes to allow for fast iteration. At its core, the entire design sprint follows a basic four-step process: Idea Generation, Prototype Creation, Testing, Analyze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before a designer picks a single color, sets a mood, or gets excited about a typeface they’ll get to use (this new version of my site was made for the sole purpose using IBM Plex, but I digress), they need to ask questions to know they’re solving the right problems. Good design is the understanding and application of meaningful, pointed research. Step one, Idea Generation, is intended to find these questions by cultivating wild thinking and inventive problem-solving. At this stage, it’s impossible to have a bad idea or a meaningless concept. Every inch of your creative-prowess should be brought to bear without room for doubt or self-defeating reason.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After an idea is organized enough to move forward, the next step is the creation of a disposable prototype. Disposable being the key action to focus on. We’re not looking for the best, nor do we need it. This step of the process is where we’ll save both time and energy by doing the absolute bare minimum that will achieve a meaningful result. For example, you want to create a new brand of cookies to sell in hip all-natural grocery stores. You need a factory to meet the demands of these stores, but you wouldn’t build the factory first. You would bake a small batch, give them away to a few people, and watch for and listen to their feedback. Now, rather than creating the factory and hiring the workers to make the wrong type of cookie, you can scale your idea up in a smart and efficient way. You may even find out you’ve been making terrible cookies but the best dog-biscuits the world’s happiest beings have ever enjoyed. Wouldn’t that be wonderful?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where Do We Start&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll save breaking down the Design Sprint in its entirety for another time. What’s important now is understanding how this style of thinking can help each of us to move forward in a satisfying, fulfilling, and productive way. What follows is my personal experience of moving through this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Starting Line&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get moving, I decided to sit and consider what I think my values are at this point in time. Asking this question offers me a place to start as well as a way to gauge how any changes have affected me over the course of time. To do this, I grabbed a journal and a pen and got to writing words I feel I stand for. Nothing neat, just a list written as it came to mind. None of these could be wrong, it didn’t matter if there were duplicates, synonyms, or antonyms, and I didn’t set a time-limit.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only restrictions I gave myself for this process were when I performed it and that it had to be written, not typed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I purposefully waited until I was in a happy, productive, and optimistic mindset to write this list. As part of who I currently am, I fight bouts of depression and overall melancholy. Understanding this about myself was a critical piece to making this first step a success. The perfect time came to fruition when I was able to swing into a great new coffee shop riding the optimistic highs of a successful meeting with new clients about potential work.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing these values down in a journal allowed for a large number of positives to contribute to the process. Keeping the computer closed meant no distractions, no unexpected social-media scroll pits, and the inability to delete. There is also a fat stack of research showing that writing causes deeper connections in memory and thought which clearly made it the right tool for this step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking this step alone was generously therapeutic. Having a clear understanding of how my present-day self considers himself was a strong cornerstone to lay. After a free-flowing, vanilla-caramel cold-brew fueled brainstorm, I decided to organize the list into five categories that seemed to be connections through the list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health&lt;/strong&gt;: Growth, Persistence, Doing, Vitality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Respect&lt;/strong&gt;: Timeliness, Discipline, Integrity, Accountability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creativity&lt;/strong&gt;: Adventure, Hope, Wonder, Courage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security&lt;/strong&gt;: Freedom, Strength, Control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fulfillment&lt;/strong&gt;: Family, Fun, Success, Service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Time to Dream&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my favorite part of practicing the design sprint. Letting the mind wander into the craziest futures unhindered by real-world practicality is reinvigorating to the once boundless optimism I carried. What dreams from the teenage years are still lingering? What am I missing out on in this world? What will my biggest regrets be? What type of lives am I capable of living? Who could be in my life? I can feel typing these questions has my subconscious going wild, causing a visceral feeling of hopefulness with a potential for untold amounts of joy and delight.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A future to fit what many of you would consider wild and unrealistic but always at the top of my list- rally driving. I’ve always loved the elements that rally driving has the ability to merge together. Traveling the world to see many of the most secluded, beautiful, emotionally engrossing areas humankind has the privilege to surround themselves within. The adrenaline-fueled, focused courage balanced by practiced skill and painstaking preparations. The sounds, smells, and trust of engineering contrasted by the solitude and merciless brutality of nature. The deep-bonded brotherhood between a driver, co-driver, and the engineers. Rally driving sounds like the most complete human experience possible in the modern world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ready, Steady, Go&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a pause here and begin the process. Make a plan for when and where you may be able to best reflect on yourself. You may thrive on the impulsiveness of trying this now, or you may require the same careful planning and considerations I did to ensure you’re doing this in the best way for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write one list: What do you value in the present, and what would you like to value in the future. Mix the two together. Don’t worry about what’s filling the page, just write it down if you think it truly matters to you. Write it down if you think it will positively shape who you want to become in the future. Write it down if it crossed your thought more than once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, within a week of creating this list write down the wildest versions of your future that you would fight to have true. There are no right or wrong answers here. Nothing too practical or unrealistic. Challenge yourself to dream up five versions of what your future can be, but if you can think of 50 that’s all the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This series of posts will be following my own experience throughout this process. I’ll be sharing my thoughts on employing design thinking to your life, the outcomes of each stage of the process, and the ways I think you can practice it for yourself. Staying true to the design sprint concept, there will be many ideas and concepts that are shared, tried, then ultimately discarded. This will force a lifestyle of new experiences, learned knowledge, and growth in character. Which, I suppose, makes it a guaranteed success.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[First Steps Towards Your Best Self Part 3- Eat]]></title><description><![CDATA[This is Part 3 of a small series on how to improve your life

&lt;p&gt;This is Part 3 of a small series on how to improve your life
with only a few small changes.
&lt;a href=&quot;../yourfirststeps-part1/&quot;&gt;Read Part 1-Sleep here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;../yourfirststeps-part2/&quot;&gt;Read Part 2-Move here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Diet is a Can of Gummy Worms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people will tell you to follow the diet they did last year because it’s so simple to follow and they saw incredible results. Then they’ll tell you that they’re about to start again because they put all the weight back on after stopping the diet last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that doesn’t sound like a healthy solution!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No More Diets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dieting is a bad idea. Dieting isn’t simple, if it were, we’d all be doing the same thing and looking like the perfect specimens of human evolution that we know we could be. If dieting were simple, entire multi-billion dollar industries wouldn’t exist. If we all knew how to eat and stay healthy, do you think there would be pizza delivery to every address in the United States? If we all knew how to consciously choose when to eat sugar, that checkout counters at every grocery store would be lined with sugar snacks? If we could all make these easy diet choices, would we need drugs for cholesterol, high-blood pressure, and all the other problems doctors and pharmacies love to prescribe for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dieting isn’t easy. Dieting is tough because many people see it as a short-term solution. “Six-pack abs in 2 weeks!” exclaims a tabloid cover at the checkout-aisle that you’re currently dropping a family-pack of Oreos, frozen pizzas, and a 2-liter of sugar-water on. Then after eating those Oreos and finishing off the pizza the kids didn’t eat, you decide it’s time to get back on your low-carb diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About Your Food&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dieting isn’t going to get you to your goals. A healthy lifestyle that weighs the pros and cons of the food you eat, however, will. This is why I chose nutrition as the last topic of the basics to discuss with you. It’s the hardest to understand, the most difficult to follow, and the most guilt-inducing part of the puzzle for nearly everyone looking to make a healthier version of themselves. However, don’t beat yourself up over the Oreo’s. A healthy, nutrition-dense lifestyle is going to take time to develop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your nutrition isn’t as easy as what goes in is what comes out. Your nutrition is going to have physiological, timeliness, environmental, social variables, and more to consider. You think Keto sounds great until your friends order a pizza, then it’s your cheat day. You think Paleo sounds great until your friend makes a Peanut Butter and Jelly sandwich, then it’s your cheat day. Your co-workers want to celebrate after work with drinks, so you have a beer with them tonight— and again at the next celebration tomorrow. This is nothing but a cycle of guilt that you have no need to bear the weight of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Give Yourself a Break&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start simple. Make your home-life as food-temptation free as possible. Start with the easy targets: Cookies, cakes, snacks, sodas, frozen pizzas. When it’s your turn to grocery shop for the family, don’t bring home the cookies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your body is that incredible machine we keep talking about. Your brain doesn’t always control your choices, as powerful as you think your mind is. Thinking with your gut is being proven with a lot of powerful research to be more than a saying. Think about the logic for a second: You’ve been feeding your body sugar and other bad-nutrients for years, decades even, and is adapted in a way to run on that fuel. Suddenly, you’ve stopped giving your body the fuel it’s learned to run on. In response, your body powers up all of the cravings and addiction responses it can, trying to manipulate you (you read that right, you’re being unknowingly manipulated by yourself) into giving into the demands of the fuel it wants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve made it through the cravings, you’ll begin to remember what healthy is. Getting pizza at lunch no longer sounds appetizing. No longer are you pushing away guilt, but replacing that feeling with a sense of fulfillment as you know you’ve made a choice better for yourself— and still plenty delicious in the food options!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You go to the grocery store now and don’t even think to go down the cookie aisle. You visit the cereal aisle less- if only to get coffee because the grocery store knows one morning addiction will help to fuel the other. You visit the produce aisle more, you visit the butcher more, you don’t even consider the candy at checkout anymore. All of this from only the small step of not bringing bad food into your home. Next step is eating out and in social situations, but let’s not get ahead of the purpose of this series- the basics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basic Tactics for Better Nutrition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consistency: Stop dieting. Start making better choices that can last you a lifetime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Variety: Don’t always buy the same fruit, vegetables, and cuts of meat. Visit different stores. Their produce may be sourced from different regions of the world, giving you a small shift in the variety of nutrients that you otherwise may not be able to obtain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think outside the box: If it’s able to sit on a shelf, unrefrigerated, in a box, then think how long it will be able to stay inside your body. This doesn’t apply to everything but is a good basic rule to start thinking twice about the choices you’re making.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grow your own: Have space for a small garden? Reconnect with your food and grow your own veggies. You’ll learn something along the way, start to appreciate the health of your home-grown foods more, and know exactly what went into growing them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trust yourself, train your gut: If you go to pick anything up, and I mean anything, if your brain tells you no, put it back! Your instincts know what is good and what is bad for your body, make your gut listen to your brain. Some food may not taste that great, but you’ll find ways of cooking to improve it, or better yet- your body will learn what real, natural, nutrient-dense food tastes like and start craving these foods again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Start Simple&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For anything as important as your health, starting simple is the best foundation. You have one body, one chance. You don’t have to live a monk’s life but giving your body the best chances to operate the way it’s meant to will give you the best chances to live the life you want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t stress over your macros, don’t worry if your workout split is allowing enough recovery time, don’t get stuck in information paralysis. Fall back on the basics, on your natural foundations, and you’ll be set up to succeed brilliantly in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[First Steps Towards Your Best Self Part 2- Move]]></title><description><![CDATA[This is Part 2 of a small series on how to improve your life

with only a few small changes.
&lt;a href=&quot;../yourfirststeps-part1/&quot;&gt;Read Part 1-Sleep here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Get Up and Move&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you’re rested, it’s time to use all of that new found energy. Let’s take a look at where you most likely stand on the activity scale right now. Well, that’s odd, it says you’re sitting.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know that most Americans will walk less than 1 mile per day? Think about this, in roughly 16 hours of conscious time you have managed to not sit at a desk, in a car, or otherwise be stationary for more than 1 mile. Starting to see why your body doesn’t feel great?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving is what our bodies are made to do. Everything we have evolved to overcome and specialize in has been in the name of movement. In our modern culture, there isn’t the same impetus as chasing down your family’s next meal while carrying your world on your back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It Takes Moves to Solve Problems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of today’s health epidemics, such as obesity and diabetes, are being maximized by stationary lifestyles. Our body relies on movement as an indicator of what systems are necessary, and which can be turned off to allow for efficiencies in other areas. Use it or lose it is the basic rule our bodies run on. You sit all day and have no need to move other than walking to the corner store for lunch? Then let’s reduce the capacity of your lungs, heart, and cardiovascular system. We don’t need it! You don’t have a chance at running into some weird bug, getting cut by a sharp bush, or breaking an ankle on a run? Let’s lower the energy in your immune system, you’re safe right where you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Human body is incredible at adapting to the environment surrounding it. Look at how we’ve managed to spread around the world and stay relatively alike. Unlike every other member of the animal kingdom, we didn’t become full-blown specialists. We’re able to adapt, to be the best generalists the earth has ever seen and are thriving for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all need to move, your quality of life depends on it. We don’t all need to be athletes or feel the pressure to exercise that social media pushes on many of us. We just need to move. You don’t need a reason. You don’t need a goal. You only need to get moving. Get up and walk for 10 minutes, then come back to this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you feel? Re-energized? Accomplished? Maybe a little sweaty and sore? Fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try 15 minutes tomorrow and take note of how you feel after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Basic Tactics to get moving more:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consistency: Find a time in your day that you feel low on energy, usually reach for a sugar-filled snack or another cup of coffee. Before you think about taking a nap, go for that walk, do ten pushups, maybe find a yoga routine that can get you moving in ways you normally don’t. Whatever you do, stay consistent with your time. Your body is an amazing machine, but it’s also easy to trick. Instead of dreading the afternoon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t swing for the fences: Start small. Walk a mile before you run a mile. Do basic stretches before you jump into yoga. Stay above water before you start lapping the pool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build it in: Fit movement into your busy day. Many people skip the elevator and take the stairs. If you’re able, walk to the local coffee shop in the afternoon instead of reaching for your office or home-brewed cup. Take the kids outside and play a game of soccer with them, but actually play with them!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get addicted: After every session, no matter how hard, easy, or sweat inducing, tell yourself it was worth it. Mentally train your body to love movement. Be proud of your accomplishments, no matter how big or small they are. They’re your accomplishments to use as fuel to power the next. Your brain is magic, but it can still be tricked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hydrate: Drink your water, and lots of it. Don’t reach for sugar-filled juices and sports drinks. Straight, plain-ol’ water is the treat your body wants after any workout. However, there are many studies showing that your body craves minerals after losing them to sweat and energy creation for workouts, so grab some mineral water if you can!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is learning how to better yourself really so complicated, that we need to cipher through millions of pieces of results? How do you even know that any of those articles, papers, blog posts, podcasts, or videos will be the right method for you to achieve your goals?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Splits, HIIT, keto, 3x8, push-pull, anabolic, CrossFit- what is all this? Guess you’ll need to pay an expert to help you get started. Maybe the gym down the road can help, but you don’t feel comfortable working out with others. Oh boy, there it is again: Where do you start?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Keep It Simple&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s nothing wrong with simple. Simple is effective, quick, understandable, and expandable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your health, fitness, and athletic abilities can all be managed, understood, and maximized within three basic pillars: Eat, Sleep, and Move. That’s it. Working to better those three areas is all it takes to level up your health. We’re not going to talk about a diet, we’re not going to talk about sleep patterns, we’re not going to talk about workout routines. All you need to get started is the knowledge that your body wants good nutrition, deep sleep, and to move how it has evolved to over 6 million years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;To Start, Sleep&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to improve your quality of life is to improve the quality of sleep in your life. If you’re waking up feeling groggy, requiring coffee to wake up, or feeling the fog finally lift hours after waking up- you’re in dire need of a sleep fix!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s my favorite thing to hear, and to be fair, my younger self was guilty of saying it, too: “I’ll sleep when I’m dead!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are enough hours in a day for you to get a good, restful sleep and still accomplish everything you can dream of. Sure, there are times in everyone’s life where sleep is sacrificed— You work two jobs, have kids, have a large responsibility to something or someone that cuts into your sleep, but why is it that sleep is the first thing we all think to sacrifice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep is the only chance your body has to properly restore, recover, and repair all of its necessary functions. This includes your mental capabilities, your physical growth, and your overall sense of well being. Proper deep sleep will improve all areas of your life, allowing you more potential growth than downing another can of sugar-filled, carbonated energy ever will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Basic Tactics for Better Sleep:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay consistent. It’s said to take 28 days to form a habit. Make yourself get in bed, ready to sleep, at the same time every night and your body will respond by giving you better and more effective sleep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cut caffeine and other uppers out up to 5 hours before sleep. In fact, try to reduce your caffeine intake overall and watch your energy levels increase!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dark and Cold will make you sleep long and deep. Think back to the environments our early ancestors evolved through. Before clothes, shelters, and even fire, our bodies responded to the dark and cold of the night by sleeping. Use this evolutionary left-over to trigger a natural deep sleep cycle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a night-time routine. You have enough time to stress about your day to day work and all the other things life can throw your way. Create a routine that can calm your mind and tell your body it’s time to rest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Declutter. Make your bedroom a sleep sanctuary. Build yourself a hibernation fortress and you will sleep incredibly. Keep your room free of stress reminders such as dirty laundry, used cups, and work-day items. Some people go as far as to remove stressful talk from the bedroom to have nothing but positive and restful associations with their sleep space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sleep is Everything&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without getting control of your sleep, you’re going to be pushing uphill against the weight of low performance across all areas of life. You can’t eat your way out of bad sleep, you can’t run yourself back from bad sleep. Get the rest your body needs and you’ll see improvements across the board. Stress management, sustained energy, increased vitality, muscle growth, and injury prevention all start while you’re asleep. Take your first step towards better health with a good night’s sleep.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
