Now I do admit that as the industry has grown and matured, it’s difficult not to bump into another pixel-worker in day-to-day life. Somehow, 90% of the people I’ve met in this industry have been incredible in some form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a palatable sense of friendliness, acceptance, motivation, and care that seems to be carried by most people in this industry. This feeling is one of my favorite parts of calling myself a web-worker. Seriously, most people in web rock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve started gathering a list of people I highly recommend paying attention to, getting to know, and to appreciate what they’ve done for all of their peers in the web industry. By no means is this the end-all be-all of web lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This list is going to include names such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chris Coyier&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sarah Parmenter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ethan Marcotte&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Denise Jacobs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wes Bos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NPJ&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jeffrey Zeldman&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chris Do&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;David Walsh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eric Meyer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rachel Andrew&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jen Simmons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brad Frost&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and so many more&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously folks, you’re all incredible. Thank you for everything you’ve done for our industry and all of those people you’ve helped grow to be the next generation of pixel-workers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Fast App]]></title><description><![CDATA[There is so much going on.

&lt;p&gt;I need to plan, build, and release a small app. I’ve had ideas piling up for years, but now it’s time to move. Responsibilities at my full-time job are growing, client deadlines are getting tighter, a partnership for another app is forming, and there’s a baby coming in October. There is so much going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What To Build&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m writing this to help me think this out. My gut says create a workout app. My version of the standard tracking app. A tracker that gets out of the way but keeps you moving in the right direction. I’ve had a multitude of versions and concepts, know the gotchas and the areas to improve on - and I’m trying to convince myself to not build this yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I’m trying to convince myself out of the workout space is to force a new idea to come out. Most likely, I’ll be building a workout app by the end of this writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m also planning a large app in the live-music space. This is going to be a huge undertaking in and of itself. Building something small this week to help me learn a few things or find my blind-spots in that app could be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also have to finish creating an app that ties into an e-commerce solution for a current, amazing client. I’m considering building this on a rails-api/react stack due to my comfort levels in these areas. The flexibility of an easy to adapt api back-end paired with the device-reach capabilities within the react ecosystem is a large contributor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to lay out my priorities to help make this decision:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The MVP should be deliverable within 1 week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web First in delivery, Mobile focused in use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subscription model, $5/month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I must see worth in the overall idea&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should have plenty of room for growth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Should it be MinMax?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health space has so many players because there is a space for everyone’s approach. I’ve been sitting on MinMax for so long, and I really want to see it through. I’ve been fighting more of an ethical battle over the future of the concept, but I think it’s time to jump in and do it. The ethical problems are a long reach. Concern over the use of the math and structures I’ve been developing for the concept are what I’m worried about, but I think this is my cynical mind taking over- but most likely my mind looking for a way to validate why I haven’t built this yet. Version 1 of MinMax may just have to be the most basic of work out apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Build In The Open&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, It’s going to be MinMax. Workout tracking with a leveling system, with plans to build workout planning to help leveling along with machine learning magic to help individual users down their own paths. 1-week to get to a working app, with another week most likely to get to shipped and at a level of payment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Studying the Human Body]]></title><description><![CDATA[The human body is far more incredible than I ever realized.

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example- I just learned that the heart wants to naturally beat about 100 times per minute. Your body actively slows this to what is your resting heart rate- 60 to 80 BPM for most people. Then as part of a response to stress does your body lower this slowing-signal and allow your heart to raise its beating pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forever, I’ve always thought that the resting heart rate was the baseline your body ran at. Instead, the body essentially ‘keeps some in the tank’ for quick reaction to outside stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which makes complete and total sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just these first few chapters have already made me confident that this studying is going to pay off in so many ways. I appreciate that the program I’m using, &lt;a href=&quot;https://acefitness.org&quot;&gt;ACE&lt;/a&gt;, has made it clear that Personal Training is far more than what many (myself included) must assume it to be. Trainers aren’t picking exercises or activities from a list and assigning them- they truly know the body and why it’s acting the way it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The level of information I’m being slammed with already is incredible. If anything, I can’t wait until I’m in a position where I can share this information in a meaningful and helpful way for the people around me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heart rate example above has already sparked some thoughts towards researching anxiety. Maybe there’s something about all of the systems that come together to raise heart rates and prepare your body for ‘fight or flight’ that is really the cause for many of the debilitating anxiety stories I’ve heard.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Athlean-X and Supporting The Honest Givers]]></title><description><![CDATA[I’m a big fan of constant learning.

I obsessively watch YouTube videos on a breath of topics, religiously listen to podcasts that go deep into areas I didn’t know could be so interesting, and I will do everything I can to support the people that make this all possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of what I write about is a self-targeted sense of improvement. My main focus at this time is a physical improvement. My body needs to regain a sense of proper functioning, giving it the ability to support other areas of my life. I wrote the other day about a World Cup inspired workout, but I decided to rethink my real goals. I need to form a strong base. One that targeted, functional programming can benefit off of. I went back to an old resource for fitness information, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe0TLA0EsQbE-MjuHXevj2A&quot;&gt;Jeff Cavaliere&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeff runs a Youtube Channel devoted to sharing information. He does sell programs, supplements, shirts, and other items at his website &lt;a href=&quot;https://athleanx.com&quot;&gt;https://athleanx.com&lt;/a&gt;. However, he himself has said you don’t need to buy his programs to be successful. He shares it all on his YouTube channel and does a great job of communicating in a way you can trust him. I went and purchased his Max Size 90-day program because of his honest, truthful, and giving approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day 1 is Monday, July 16 day 90 will be October 14. I’m going to share my experience and progress along the way both here and potentially in other places.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Coffee and Success]]></title><description><![CDATA[Mornings and I haven’t seen much of each other for the better part of a decade.

The only way I was getting up with the sun was to put in a round of 18 with my father and brothers at our favorite golf course. Living the 10 am to 3 am life had its perks, but that life has long passed. I’m still not an early riser by many standards, however, I’ve made the shift happen by using one simple trick: Be successful as soon as possible after waking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Don’t Consume, Create!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a plague silently befalling the modern connected world. It happens across the country each morning causing the loss of precious time to live: The Social Media scroll. Many mornings today start with a roll-over, checking the time on a phone, and then time-travel 10 minutes, 20 minutes, an hour into the future after falling into the black hole of social media. Then, starting the day after this mind-numbing, unbeneficial activity is slow, groggy, and probably rushed because your addiction to the scroll took your brain away from time-awareness and you’re late for everything. No wonder so many people hate mornings more than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing we should be consuming in the morning is breakfast, water,  and coffee. Let’s use that coffee addiction to trick ourselves into better mornings. Many people are already queuing up their favorite morning excuse “I can’t do anything before I have my coffee.” Well, bullshit. If you’re that dependant on coffee to get moving in the morning, there are other areas of your life that need fixing, it’s not the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can you do tomorrow morning that will take 5 minutes, maybe 10 minutes, that will earn you that coffee? Here’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/7-minute-workout/id650762525&quot;&gt;7-minute workout ios app&lt;/a&gt;. Run for 5 minutes in one direction, turn around and come back. Meditate. Journal or work on a small article. Work on that side-project you’ve been dreaming of for years. Don’t play video games, don’t read, don’t watch television, stay away from social media. You need to produce something of meaning. Something that will help you to feel accomplished before that perfect caffeinated elixir touches your lips. After a few days of this, you’ll own your mornings rather than your morning coffee owning you.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[World Cup Fitness Inspiration]]></title><description><![CDATA[The World Cup brings to my life an incredible joy every four years.

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Cup brings to my life an incredible joy every four years. It also offers an interesting moment to consider how life has changed over the last cycle of international play. During the 2014 games, I was single and living in a pool house with all the time in the world to exercise, cook full &amp;#x26; healthy meals for myself, and enjoy athletic activities at my leisure. This time I’m a bonus dad to three girls negotiating levels of cheese covered carbs, balancing schedules, and in serious lack of real competitive sporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s taken some time to adapt, but I’m finally finding ways to bring fitness back into this frenetic life. It’s taken strong efforts in prioritization, compromise, and a bit of creativity to find the moments and the right activities to regain a sense of fun fitness in my lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I Love the World Cup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014, I was the typical American soccer fan. I watched the world cup, tried to sound like I knew what I was talking about based on my time playing in High School, and used it as an excuse to throw mid-day, alcohol-fueled pool parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Dailey Blind sent in that long, high-curling ball to Robin Van Persie in full sprint. The diving header Robin played at the end of Blind’s pass was a vision of the incredible magic brought to the stage of World Cup play. Instantaneously, I fell back in love with this beautiful game. Thank you, Blind and Robin, for relighting my passion for the sport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last four years, I’ve been obsessed with Manchester United. Awkwardly, if you follow Premier League football, you’ll know this has been a tumultuous time in United’s history. For the better, my love of the club has only grown stronger season over clumsy season. I watched as Van Persie was pushed out when his form took a dip. I witnessed Shaw’s horrific leg injury put expectations on pause. Wayne Rooney, the face of modern United, became the all-time top scorer for the club and is now in the MLS with Schweinsteiger and Ibrahimovic. After all of this, I’m more passionate about the club and excited about its future than I have been for the past 4 years due to one big reason- Romelu Lukaku.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;World Cup 2018&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the Quarter Finals of the 2018 World Cup. Tournament favorites Brazil are playing to a raucous crowd, easily confusing the Russian stadium’s atmosphere for a home match. The opponents, Belgium, have been absorbing attack after attack and look to be running out of the barrels of luck keeping them in the match thus far. Belgium’s defense is fighting. They’re putting in top efforts, but being matched against Brazil’s forwards is going to push any team’s limits. Brazil has already had four clear chances on net and can only blame themselves for not having the points. Courtois has put in what may be his biggest career performance, absorbing Brazils every on-target effort. Belgium, however, has been using their firepower up top to scorching effect. Romelu Lukaku, Kevin de Bryune, and Eden Hazard are wreaking havoc on Brazil’s high defensive line. Later in the match, Brazil will find a way to deal with this strategy, but till then this is Lukaku’s show to run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lukaku has shown the world this tournament what many Manchester fans already know, he’s going to be one of the best to play the game. He will match the greats with goals and assists, but that’s not why he’s so inspiring to watch. It’s his unselfish, team-oriented, physical play that separates him from the pack. When Lukaku is on the ball this World Cup, you can feel the electricity in the air because something great is in the near future. The mentality, the physicality, the class, and the support he offers others makes him the ultimate athlete. He burns with a passion to win and will do the work to win. Sad that it’s become something of a joke to many United fans, but to watch as Lukaku celebrates his teammates’ goals with more fury than his own explains everything you need to know about this future Captain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Build Momentum with Mentality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t hold it against any defender if they confuse Lukaku for Juggernaught when he’s bearing down on them at full sprint. To have that speed and power of someone his size is a testament to his determined work ethic and drive to be the best. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theplayerstribune.com/en-us/articles/romelu-lukaku-ive-got-some-things-to-say&quot;&gt;Read this article at The Players Tribune&lt;/a&gt; to really understand Lukaku’s mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take this colossal motivation and do something with it. Fitness to me needs to have three things to be effective: Fun, Purpose, and Practicality. These, combined with the inspirational work ethic of Lukaku, make my baseline for deciding what action I’ll take in my fitness routines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Running is Boring&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hate it. Running is monotonous, bordering on torturous work. Explains why I played Keeper and Central Defense when I played. Knowing this, it’s high on my list of priorities. Endurance and sustained energy are two of the most practical indicators of fitness for myself. I don’t need to run a marathon, but I’d like to be able to handle sprints after an hour of high-effort play. I’m about to drop all of my motivation-through-design knowledge on myself and get myself to this goal. Here’s my plan for beating the tedium of running:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Play with the kids&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these kids won’t stop growing. At least now they’re big enough to kick the ball around! We spend 30-60 minutes every day playing and “practicing” now. If I can only fit one thing in each day, it’s this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stay Outside&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What sounds more boring than running for 10, 20, 30 minutes? Running staring at the same wall for 10, 20, 30 minutes. I’ve had to shift my sleep schedule to get my run in before the Florida heat and humidity settle in, but I have noticed many benefits to adding a morning run to the routine. Want to be run-friends on Nike Run Club? Send me a tweet and I’ll add you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Small-stepped goals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mile is just under 11 minutes currently. When I get 1 mile down to 9 minutes, I’ll start running 2. No need to run a marathon or even a 5k yet, aiming too high will only cause unnecessary frustrations, injury, and disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;HIIT and Soccer Drills&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has been my favorite addition yet. While I’m playing with the kids, I’ll set up “drills” for them, then take part myself, too. It keeps them energized, I get a workout in, and they’re starting to think of all this as play rather than a chore. Glad I held onto those cones from all those years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Power House&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I do love, is strength conditioning. In soccer, having the strength to hold off a pressing defender after sprinting up and down the pitch is an outstanding asset to have in your wheelhouse. There are countless variations of exercises to perform to build leg strength. You don’t need a gym, but I’ll be describing my routines which utilize my access to gym equipment. To warm up a lower body exercise, I’ll pick two or three of these lunge variations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jump Squats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standing Lunge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clock Lunge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Split Lunge Jump&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Walking Lunge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These lunges directly impact the leg muscles athletes need for strength, power, explosiveness, and injury resistance. Also, performing them properly will help to increase knee and leg joint health. My knees can use all the help they can get so after lunges, I’ll focus on knee health with a few of these movements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lying Leg Raises&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prone Straight Leg Raises&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supermans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lateral Lunge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wipers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that my legs know it’s time to work, I can move on to strength training. Leg day has always been my favorite within the standard workout routines because the options are so limitless, but the basics are powerful. A starting leg strength training day will typically follow this plan. Unlike the others, I’ll do everything on this list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Back or Front Squat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Romanian Deadlift&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bulgarian Split Squat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leg Press&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hip Thrust&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calf Raises&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jump Squats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re going to be running, pivoting, taking shots, sending long passes, holding defenders off, and pushing attackers off the ball you’re going to need the upper body strength to withstand all of this. Most importantly, your trunk, your abdominal and back muscles, need to be strong enough to effectively use your strength and resilient enough to keep your endurance levels high. Without this core strength, you’ll be working to keep your body upright, draining your energy and making you ineffective on the ball. I’ll add one or two of these on strength conditioning days or perform all on days out of the gym:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lying Leg Raises&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flat Plank&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Side Plank&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Walking Side Plank&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quadruped Opposite arm/leg&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Medicine Ball Overhead Throws&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Medicine Ball Side Throws&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seated Russian Medicine Ball Twist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To maintain a healthy balance, arms, shoulders, and chest should still be targetted. In addition to balance, increasing the strength in these areas will make your sprinting, body blocking, and even your shots more powerful. It’s important to understand that explosive strength comes from your entire body, not a single muscle group. These workouts are normally grouped into two routines based on pushing and pulling movements. One day for push, another day for pull:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Push&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flat Chest Press&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incline Dumbbell Press&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standing Military Press&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wide-Grip Upright Rows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dips&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lateral Raise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cable Pushdown&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Pull&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deadlift&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pull Ups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bent Over Rows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lat Pull-Down&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rear Delt Flye&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bicep Dumbbell Curl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cable Crunch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;All Together Now&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This type of training would work on a schedule such as this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Monday:&lt;/em&gt; Legs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tuesday:&lt;/em&gt; Outdoor training, trunk, and joint health&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wednesday:&lt;/em&gt; Push&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thursday:&lt;/em&gt; Outdoor training, trunk, and joint health&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Friday:&lt;/em&gt; Pull&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Saturday and Sunday:&lt;/em&gt; Active Rest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This schedule gives your body time to rest the areas you’ve worked while allowing you to stay active and consistent with your efforts. Don’t work through pain, don’t skip out on sleep and actual rest, and make sure to eat in a way that fits your energy requirements.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Design Your Life]]></title><description><![CDATA[Students are the best.

They teach us more about ourselves than we could have ever presumed they could. I’ve been repeating a simple commentary to many enthusiastic but quietly disheartened early designers for a decade when asked to critique their self-branding. “You are your toughest client.” Websites, logos, flyers, business cards, resumes, and apps. Anything they’re developing to show the world why they’re different and better than their professional competition. All the while thinking that this self-directed branding will be what shapes their careers for the next 40 years. It’s commonly an enjoyable, sometimes uncomfortable discussion, but obviously necessary to their growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discussion normally yields questions in the shape of “Who do you want to work with in the future,” “Where do you want to live and work in 10 years,” and “Why did you start down this career path” amongst other pointed directives. Yet, here I am, astonished at the fact I never considered to take the challenge of this thought process a giant step further: Why not design your life?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Toughest Client You Will Ever Have&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working in an area of design for even a small amount of time, you will find that there are processes and guidelines for finding a solution or working with people that are not sure what they’re after. These standardized steps help to keep businesses moving efficiently and help to make the designer seem less like a magician and more like an architect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are different processes for various areas of design, diverse types of people and companies, and enough to fit a variety of timelines and budgets. A favorite of mine, which I’ve been fortunate to be able to research, teach, and employ for years is the Design Sprint. This process is what I’ll be working to implement directed and meaningful transformation in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Design Sprint’s power is wielded through two main factors: Iteration and Understanding. To use it effectively in the design profession, we rely on research and user interviews to attain understanding while creating disposable prototypes to allow for fast iteration. At its core, the entire design sprint follows a basic four-step process: Idea Generation, Prototype Creation, Testing, Analyze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before a designer picks a single color, sets a mood, or gets excited about a typeface they’ll get to use (this new version of my site was made for the sole purpose using IBM Plex, but I digress), they need to ask questions to know they’re solving the right problems. Good design is the understanding and application of meaningful, pointed research. Step one, Idea Generation, is intended to find these questions by cultivating wild thinking and inventive problem-solving. At this stage, it’s impossible to have a bad idea or a meaningless concept. Every inch of your creative-prowess should be brought to bear without room for doubt or self-defeating reason.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After an idea is organized enough to move forward, the next step is the creation of a disposable prototype. Disposable being the key action to focus on. We’re not looking for the best, nor do we need it. This step of the process is where we’ll save both time and energy by doing the absolute bare minimum that will achieve a meaningful result. For example, you want to create a new brand of cookies to sell in hip all-natural grocery stores. You need a factory to meet the demands of these stores, but you wouldn’t build the factory first. You would bake a small batch, give them away to a few people, and watch for and listen to their feedback. Now, rather than creating the factory and hiring the workers to make the wrong type of cookie, you can scale your idea up in a smart and efficient way. You may even find out you’ve been making terrible cookies but the best dog-biscuits the world’s happiest beings have ever enjoyed. Wouldn’t that be wonderful?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where Do We Start&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll save breaking down the Design Sprint in its entirety for another time. What’s important now is understanding how this style of thinking can help each of us to move forward in a satisfying, fulfilling, and productive way. What follows is my personal experience of moving through this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Starting Line&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get moving, I decided to sit and consider what I think my values are at this point in time. Asking this question offers me a place to start as well as a way to gauge how any changes have affected me over the course of time. To do this, I grabbed a journal and a pen and got to writing words I feel I stand for. Nothing neat, just a list written as it came to mind. None of these could be wrong, it didn’t matter if there were duplicates, synonyms, or antonyms, and I didn’t set a time-limit.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only restrictions I gave myself for this process were when I performed it and that it had to be written, not typed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I purposefully waited until I was in a happy, productive, and optimistic mindset to write this list. As part of who I currently am, I fight bouts of depression and overall melancholy. Understanding this about myself was a critical piece to making this first step a success. The perfect time came to fruition when I was able to swing into a great new coffee shop riding the optimistic highs of a successful meeting with new clients about potential work.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing these values down in a journal allowed for a large number of positives to contribute to the process. Keeping the computer closed meant no distractions, no unexpected social-media scroll pits, and the inability to delete. There is also a fat stack of research showing that writing causes deeper connections in memory and thought which clearly made it the right tool for this step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking this step alone was generously therapeutic. Having a clear understanding of how my present-day self considers himself was a strong cornerstone to lay. After a free-flowing, vanilla-caramel cold-brew fueled brainstorm, I decided to organize the list into five categories that seemed to be connections through the list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health&lt;/strong&gt;: Growth, Persistence, Doing, Vitality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Respect&lt;/strong&gt;: Timeliness, Discipline, Integrity, Accountability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creativity&lt;/strong&gt;: Adventure, Hope, Wonder, Courage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security&lt;/strong&gt;: Freedom, Strength, Control, Calm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fulfillment&lt;/strong&gt;: Family, Fun, Success, Service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Time to Dream&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my favorite part of practicing the design sprint. Letting the mind wander into the craziest futures unhindered by real-world practicality is reinvigorating to the once boundless optimism I carried. What dreams from the teenage years are still lingering? What am I missing out on in this world? What will my biggest regrets be? What type of lives am I capable of living? Who could be in my life? I can feel typing these questions has my subconscious going wild, causing a visceral feeling of hopefulness with a potential for untold amounts of joy and delight.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A future to fit what many of you would consider wild and unrealistic but always at the top of my list- rally driving. I’ve always loved the elements that rally driving has the ability to merge together. Traveling the world to see many of the most secluded, beautiful, emotionally engrossing areas humankind has the privilege to surround themselves within. The adrenaline-fueled, focused courage balanced by practiced skill and painstaking preparations. The sounds, smells, and trust of engineering contrasted by the solitude and merciless brutality of nature. The deep-bonded brotherhood between a driver, co-driver, and the engineers. Rally driving sounds like the most complete human experience possible in the modern world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ready, Steady, Go&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a pause here and begin the process. Make a plan for when and where you may be able to best reflect on yourself. You may thrive on the impulsiveness of trying this now, or you may require the same careful planning and considerations I did to ensure you’re doing this in the best way for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write one list: What do you value in the present, and what would you like to value in the future. Mix the two together. Don’t worry about what’s filling the page, just write it down if you think it truly matters to you. Write it down if you think it will positively shape who you want to become in the future. Write it down if it crossed your thought more than once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, within a week of creating this list write down the wildest versions of your future that you would fight to have true. There are no right or wrong answers here. Nothing too practical or unrealistic. Challenge yourself to dream up five versions of what your future can be, but if you can think of 50 that’s all the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This series of posts will be following my own experience throughout this process. I’ll be sharing my thoughts on employing design thinking to your life, the outcomes of each stage of the process, and the ways I think you can practice it for yourself. Staying true to the design sprint concept, there will be many ideas and concepts that are shared, tried, then ultimately discarded. This will force a lifestyle of new experiences, learned knowledge, and growth in character. Which, I suppose, makes it a guaranteed success.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[First Steps Towards Your Best Self Part 3- Eat]]></title><description><![CDATA[This is Part 3 of a small series on how to improve your life

&lt;p&gt;This is Part 3 of a small series on how to improve your life
with only a few small changes.
&lt;a href=&quot;../yourfirststeps-part1/&quot;&gt;Read Part 1-Sleep here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;../yourfirststeps-part2/&quot;&gt;Read Part 2-Move here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Diet is a Can of Gummy Worms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people will tell you to follow the diet they did last year because it’s so simple to follow and they saw incredible results. Then they’ll tell you that they’re about to start again because they put all the weight back on after stopping the diet last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that doesn’t sound like a healthy solution!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No More Diets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dieting is a bad idea. Dieting isn’t simple, if it were, we’d all be doing the same thing and looking like the perfect specimens of human evolution that we know we could be. If dieting were simple, entire multi-billion dollar industries wouldn’t exist. If we all knew how to eat and stay healthy, do you think there would be pizza delivery to every address in the United States? If we all knew how to consciously choose when to eat sugar, that checkout counters at every grocery store would be lined with sugar snacks? If we could all make these easy diet choices, would we need drugs for cholesterol, high-blood pressure, and all the other problems doctors and pharmacies love to prescribe for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dieting isn’t easy. Dieting is tough because many people see it as a short-term solution. “Six-pack abs in 2 weeks!” exclaims a tabloid cover at the checkout-aisle that you’re currently dropping a family-pack of Oreos, frozen pizzas, and a 2-liter of sugar-water on. Then after eating those Oreos and finishing off the pizza the kids didn’t eat, you decide it’s time to get back on your low-carb diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About Your Food&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dieting isn’t going to get you to your goals. A healthy lifestyle that weighs the pros and cons of the food you eat, however, will. This is why I chose nutrition as the last topic of the basics to discuss with you. It’s the hardest to understand, the most difficult to follow, and the most guilt-inducing part of the puzzle for nearly everyone looking to make a healthier version of themselves. However, don’t beat yourself up over the Oreo’s. A healthy, nutrition-dense lifestyle is going to take time to develop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your nutrition isn’t as easy as what goes in is what comes out. Your nutrition is going to have physiological, timeliness, environmental, social variables, and more to consider. You think Keto sounds great until your friends order a pizza, then it’s your cheat day. You think Paleo sounds great until your friend makes a Peanut Butter and Jelly sandwich, then it’s your cheat day. Your co-workers want to celebrate after work with drinks, so you have a beer with them tonight— and again at the next celebration tomorrow. This is nothing but a cycle of guilt that you have no need to bear the weight of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Give Yourself a Break&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start simple. Make your home-life as food-temptation free as possible. Start with the easy targets: Cookies, cakes, snacks, sodas, frozen pizzas. When it’s your turn to grocery shop for the family, don’t bring home the cookies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your body is that incredible machine we keep talking about. Your brain doesn’t always control your choices, as powerful as you think your mind is. Thinking with your gut is being proven with a lot of powerful research to be more than a saying. Think about the logic for a second: You’ve been feeding your body sugar and other bad-nutrients for years, decades even, and is adapted in a way to run on that fuel. Suddenly, you’ve stopped giving your body the fuel it’s learned to run on. In response, your body powers up all of the cravings and addiction responses it can, trying to manipulate you (you read that right, you’re being unknowingly manipulated by yourself) into giving into the demands of the fuel it wants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve made it through the cravings, you’ll begin to remember what healthy is. Getting pizza at lunch no longer sounds appetizing. No longer are you pushing away guilt, but replacing that feeling with a sense of fulfillment as you know you’ve made a choice better for yourself— and still plenty delicious in the food options!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You go to the grocery store now and don’t even think to go down the cookie aisle. You visit the cereal aisle less- if only to get coffee because the grocery store knows one morning addiction will help to fuel the other. You visit the produce aisle more, you visit the butcher more, you don’t even consider the candy at checkout anymore. All of this from only the small step of not bringing bad food into your home. Next step is eating out and in social situations, but let’s not get ahead of the purpose of this series- the basics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basic Tactics for Better Nutrition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consistency: Stop dieting. Start making better choices that can last you a lifetime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Variety: Don’t always buy the same fruit, vegetables, and cuts of meat. Visit different stores. Their produce may be sourced from different regions of the world, giving you a small shift in the variety of nutrients that you otherwise may not be able to obtain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think outside the box: If it’s able to sit on a shelf, unrefrigerated, in a box, then think how long it will be able to stay inside your body. This doesn’t apply to everything but is a good basic rule to start thinking twice about the choices you’re making.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grow your own: Have space for a small garden? Reconnect with your food and grow your own veggies. You’ll learn something along the way, start to appreciate the health of your home-grown foods more, and know exactly what went into growing them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trust yourself, train your gut: If you go to pick anything up, and I mean anything, if your brain tells you no, put it back! Your instincts know what is good and what is bad for your body, make your gut listen to your brain. Some food may not taste that great, but you’ll find ways of cooking to improve it, or better yet- your body will learn what real, natural, nutrient-dense food tastes like and start craving these foods again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Start Simple&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For anything as important as your health, starting simple is the best foundation. You have one body, one chance. You don’t have to live a monk’s life but giving your body the best chances to operate the way it’s meant to will give you the best chances to live the life you want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t stress over your macros, don’t worry if your workout split is allowing enough recovery time, don’t get stuck in information paralysis. Fall back on the basics, on your natural foundations, and you’ll be set up to succeed brilliantly in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[First Steps Towards Your Best Self Part 2- Move]]></title><description><![CDATA[This is Part 2 of a small series on how to improve your life

&lt;p&gt;This is Part 2 of a small series on how to improve your life
with only a few small changes.
&lt;a href=&quot;../yourfirststeps-part1/&quot;&gt;Read Part 1-Sleep here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Get Up and Move&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you’re rested, it’s time to use all of that new found energy. Let’s take a look at where you most likely stand on the activity scale right now. Well, that’s odd, it says you’re sitting.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know that most Americans will walk less than 1 mile per day? Think about this, in roughly 16 hours of conscious time you have managed to not sit at a desk, in a car, or otherwise be stationary for more than 1 mile. Starting to see why your body doesn’t feel great?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving is what our bodies are made to do. Everything we have evolved to overcome and specialize in has been in the name of movement. In our modern culture, there isn’t the same impetus as chasing down your family’s next meal while carrying your world on your back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It Takes Moves to Solve Problems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of today’s health epidemics, such as obesity and diabetes, are being maximized by stationary lifestyles. Our body relies on movement as an indicator of what systems are necessary, and which can be turned off to allow for efficiencies in other areas. Use it or lose it is the basic rule our bodies run on. You sit all day and have no need to move other than walking to the corner store for lunch? Then let’s reduce the capacity of your lungs, heart, and cardiovascular system. We don’t need it! You don’t have a chance at running into some weird bug, getting cut by a sharp bush, or breaking an ankle on a run? Let’s lower the energy in your immune system, you’re safe right where you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Human body is incredible at adapting to the environment surrounding it. Look at how we’ve managed to spread around the world and stay relatively alike. Unlike every other member of the animal kingdom, we didn’t become full-blown specialists. We’re able to adapt, to be the best generalists the earth has ever seen and are thriving for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all need to move, your quality of life depends on it. We don’t all need to be athletes or feel the pressure to exercise that social media pushes on many of us. We just need to move. You don’t need a reason. You don’t need a goal. You only need to get moving. Get up and walk for 10 minutes, then come back to this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you feel? Re-energized? Accomplished? Maybe a little sweaty and sore? Fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try 15 minutes tomorrow and take note of how you feel after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Basic Tactics to get moving more:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consistency: Find a time in your day that you feel low on energy, usually reach for a sugar-filled snack or another cup of coffee. Before you think about taking a nap, go for that walk, do ten pushups, maybe find a yoga routine that can get you moving in ways you normally don’t. Whatever you do, stay consistent with your time. Your body is an amazing machine, but it’s also easy to trick. Instead of dreading the afternoon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t swing for the fences: Start small. Walk a mile before you run a mile. Do basic stretches before you jump into yoga. Stay above water before you start lapping the pool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build it in: Fit movement into your busy day. Many people skip the elevator and take the stairs. If you’re able, walk to the local coffee shop in the afternoon instead of reaching for your office or home-brewed cup. Take the kids outside and play a game of soccer with them, but actually play with them!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get addicted: After every session, no matter how hard, easy, or sweat inducing, tell yourself it was worth it. Mentally train your body to love movement. Be proud of your accomplishments, no matter how big or small they are. They’re your accomplishments to use as fuel to power the next. Your brain is magic, but it can still be tricked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hydrate: Drink your water, and lots of it. Don’t reach for sugar-filled juices and sports drinks. Straight, plain-ol’ water is the treat your body wants after any workout. However, there are many studies showing that your body craves minerals after losing them to sweat and energy creation for workouts, so grab some mineral water if you can!&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is learning how to better yourself really so complicated, that we need to cipher through millions of pieces of results? How do you even know that any of those articles, papers, blog posts, podcasts, or videos will be the right method for you to achieve your goals?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Splits, HIIT, keto, 3x8, push-pull, anabolic, CrossFit- what is all this? Guess you’ll need to pay an expert to help you get started. Maybe the gym down the road can help, but you don’t feel comfortable working out with others. Oh boy, there it is again: Where do you start?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Keep It Simple&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s nothing wrong with simple. Simple is effective, quick, understandable, and expandable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your health, fitness, and athletic abilities can all be managed, understood, and maximized within three basic pillars: Eat, Sleep, and Move. That’s it. Working to better those three areas is all it takes to level up your health. We’re not going to talk about a diet, we’re not going to talk about sleep patterns, we’re not going to talk about workout routines. All you need to get started is the knowledge that your body wants good nutrition, deep sleep, and to move how it has evolved to over 6 million years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;To Start, Sleep&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to improve your quality of life is to improve the quality of sleep in your life. If you’re waking up feeling groggy, requiring coffee to wake up, or feeling the fog finally lift hours after waking up- you’re in dire need of a sleep fix!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s my favorite thing to hear, and to be fair, my younger self was guilty of saying it, too: “I’ll sleep when I’m dead!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are enough hours in a day for you to get a good, restful sleep and still accomplish everything you can dream of. Sure, there are times in everyone’s life where sleep is sacrificed— You work two jobs, have kids, have a large responsibility to something or someone that cuts into your sleep, but why is it that sleep is the first thing we all think to sacrifice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep is the only chance your body has to properly restore, recover, and repair all of its necessary functions. This includes your mental capabilities, your physical growth, and your overall sense of well being. Proper deep sleep will improve all areas of your life, allowing you more potential growth than downing another can of sugar-filled, carbonated energy ever will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Basic Tactics for Better Sleep:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay consistent. It’s said to take 28 days to form a habit. Make yourself get in bed, ready to sleep, at the same time every night and your body will respond by giving you better and more effective sleep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cut caffeine and other uppers out up to 5 hours before sleep. In fact, try to reduce your caffeine intake overall and watch your energy levels increase!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dark and Cold will make you sleep long and deep. Think back to the environments our early ancestors evolved through. Before clothes, shelters, and even fire, our bodies responded to the dark and cold of the night by sleeping. Use this evolutionary left-over to trigger a natural deep sleep cycle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a night-time routine. You have enough time to stress about your day to day work and all the other things life can throw your way. Create a routine that can calm your mind and tell your body it’s time to rest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Declutter. Make your bedroom a sleep sanctuary. Build yourself a hibernation fortress and you will sleep incredibly. Keep your room free of stress reminders such as dirty laundry, used cups, and work-day items. Some people go as far as to remove stressful talk from the bedroom to have nothing but positive and restful associations with their sleep space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sleep is Everything&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without getting control of your sleep, you’re going to be pushing uphill against the weight of low performance across all areas of life. You can’t eat your way out of bad sleep, you can’t run yourself back from bad sleep. Get the rest your body needs and you’ll see improvements across the board. Stress management, sustained energy, increased vitality, muscle growth, and injury prevention all start while you’re asleep. Take your first step towards better health with a good night’s sleep.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
