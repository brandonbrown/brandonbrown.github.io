The amount of articles you’ll discover as a beginner telling you what weights to lift, how often to run, what supplements to buy, or even what clothes to wear is absurd. What if you’ve never lifted a weight? What if you don’t realize your knee pain is from over-bearing run-time expectations? What if you feel unhealthy because you’ve replaced good sleep with increasing amounts of caffeine? Every article you’ve read telling you heavy lifting is the solution to your problems or that keto is a four-letter magic word are all missing the point: You are unique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One. Only one person has ever existed in this universe (yes, all of time and space) with your exact circumstances, conditions, and habits. From the second you entered this world your body was uniquely your own. That article proclaiming everyone should do the same 5 movements as beginners is starting to make less and less sense, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now with all that out of the way there is a baseline we all do share. Hypocrite much? Hold on, let me explain.
The foundations of living a healthy life are shared between every human on this planet. Without getting a handle on these five healthy-lifestyle basics your weight lifting, running, yoga, and eating schedule won’t make an impactful, healthy difference in your life. Good sleep, the right food, plenty of water, moving your body, and a better mind-set are all places that need consistently good-habits to maintain. Here are some ways to gets started or improve in all of these areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sleep&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listening to your body starts while you’re sleeping. The quality of your sleep and how you feel waking up are two important indicators of how well you’re managing your health. So the first step in feeling better all day starts at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few strategies for starting to improve your sleep:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consistent Bed Time:&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve lived the changing work schedule life for a decade of my life. The effects of 12-hour differences in start times changing monthly took its toll on my health. If you’re living this lifestyle, this first point will be the hardest to implement- but don’t disregard it if you’re able to. For those of you with consistent work and life schedules, the best step you can do is go to bed at the same time every night- yes even on the weekends! The goal here is to train your body to wake and sleep on a normal schedule. Allowing your body to form a sleep-pattern will allow it to better manage many of its functions involved in rest, recovery, and growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Routine:&lt;/strong&gt; Many productivity gurus have declared the morning routine the key to a successful day. An important key to success tomorrow is preparation today. Use your time before bed to prepare for the day ahead. Decide on your outfit, prepare your gym bag, get the kids lunches ready, check your makeup, even make sure you know where the dog’s leash is. Anything to help put your mind at ease and reduce the stress it has to internally carry. Run through a check-list that will help you destress, and your mind will be able to settle into a deeper, stronger sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lights out:&lt;/strong&gt; We live in an age of screens, there’s no getting around that without living deep off the grid. Myself, I’ve been behind a computer for half my life. I’m still guilty of late nights behind the screen and watching YouTube in bed while I fall asleep. The devices, applications, and entertainment we seek through these screens are all designed to hold our attention. This demand increases responses in our body related to stress. So as you get ready for bed, lower the lights, turn off the tv, and try to leave your phone alone!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Eat With Your Brain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know the thought: “I really shouldn’t eat this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listen:&lt;/strong&gt; Your body has evolved for millions of years and has a great set of instincts and responses that are worth listening to. Now, there are two thoughts that need to be separated here. “I shouldn’t eat this” is not the same as “I do not want to eat this.” The “I do not want to eat this” thought is the hardest habit to break when changing your diet. The other people that know our bodies have evolved to crave and require specific nutrients are those making and selling all the cheap, poor-quality food we think we want to eat! Luckily, with the health and fitness industries growing year over year, the food markets have started to respond. There are more healthy choices than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How and what to eat is one of the most personal choices you’ll make and can’t be summed up in a paragraph here. However, we should all learn how to trust our bodies with our food choices again. Take this first step and you’ll be moving in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hydrate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drink your water:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s that plain and simple. Swap out a soda with a mineral water or club soda and you’ll start to feel younger than the millennials powering these products’ fortunes. We buy them off the pallet at Costco. And, yes, I’m an elder millennial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Move&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shoes were made for walking:&lt;/strong&gt; When you set out to find an article like this from a Personal Trainer, you’re most likely expecting to hear the secret to health is more push-ups, signing up for a 5k, and lifting heavy weights 3x a week. (Side-note: These are all great things, and if you can do them you should!) We all need to start somewhere though. Thor Bjornsson had a day he lifted his first weight. Cristiano Ronaldo kicked a ball for the first-time. Usain Bolt had to learn his best sprinting form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 10-minute walk is a great place to start. If you need to, find a park with benches so you can take a comfortable rest when it’s necessary. Want to build muscle but have never lifted a weight? Let’s talk assisted body-weight movements. The only things that matters are that you get moving and start small. Your body is meant to be moved. The more you simplify exercising down to its most basic form of movement, the easier it will be for you to start building momentum towards the goals that made you start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Celebrate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you shown up for workouts consistently? Celebrate! Did you get in the gym after missing sessions for a bit too long? Celebrate! Did you do more today than you did yesterday? Celebrate!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know when it happened, but somewhere our culture has taught people that the only time to celebrate is when you’ve hit a goal others recognize as worthy. Think about that for a second- ridiculous, isn’t it? You need to celebrate along the way. Each moment you’re able to focus on your own well-being in the form of running, weight lifting, meditation, or eating well is a moment you’re choosing to celebrate the gift of life you’ve been given.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s an even more perplexing cultural norm that we need to talk about. Celebrate your failures! Yes, celebrate when things don’t go as planned. Recognizing you’ve performed below expectations, that you let yourself down, or that you’re off your plan is a trait to nurture and grow. Was your run harder today? Celebrate it. You showed up, put in the time, and can work to improve. Was the weight heavier today? Celebrate! You showed up, got under the iron, and can examine what made the weight more difficult to lift. Failure is an honest demonstration of where we have room for growth. Many times, it’s not the weight or the run that made you fail but something else in your life that needs to be examined. When you learn to give it an honest examination you’ll be able to get back on track!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Finishing Up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve presented the above in the order I would examine each foundational area. Each of these areas has plenty of overlap with the others with which you may need to examine differently for your own situation. For example: Cutting out soda may reduce your caffeine, improving your sleep. Learning to celebrate and learn from a failure may help you to reduce stress and personal-expectations allowing you to make better food choices throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these are the basic foundations of starting down the pathway of a healthy-lifestyle. While working with new clients, these are the first areas I would like to know about because of the large impacts they’ll have across their health and the expectations they can set for the future. Establishing these foundations, forming healthy habits, and feeling positive results from only a few small changes will help to show you and my clients what’s possible with a small shift in focus and a small increase in effort.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[BKMKS14]]></title><description><![CDATA[Something Great Be My Eyes Development Tiny Online Tools For Developers How to Animate on the Web With Greensock JavaScript in 5 minutes…]]></description><link>https://bybrandonbrown.com/bkmks/14/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://bybrandonbrown.com/bkmks/14/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2020 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Something Great&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to keep all of your skills sharp- especially the ones you’re most passionate about. I love building new things- which means there’s a lot to do in the development world. Sometimes I go in too much on the development which has the effect of my design work falling by the wayside- maybe becoming dull.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, to help keep these skills sharp I’ll be partaking in a daily design challenge. Not UI, not UX, not logos.. everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I enjoy, and am thankful for, this industry I’m so privileged to be a part of is the breadth of work we’re able to be a part of. Bouncing from strategy to development to making something as beautiful as it is usable is something not many work-types offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here come the designs. Today is the third, so I’ll be pumping out a few today. Everything that I’ll be sharing is practice and not oriented towards achieving any business goals. I haven’t designed for fun in a long time- this is going to be great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something I’m going to experiment with are setting some type of constraints. The easiest will be color, I’ll use &lt;a href=&quot;https://coolors.co/&quot;&gt;coolors&lt;/a&gt; to generate random colors which I’ll treat as “brand guides” I would normally not have control over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonus 1: &lt;strong&gt;Profile for a Golf Score Tracker with live updates and video/photo sharing for social interaction and honesty. &lt;a href=&quot;https://coolors.co/4e0250-801a86-645986-8fe388-58bc82&quot;&gt;Color scheme&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://dribbble.com/shots/8808609-UI-Practice-1&quot;&gt;See it on Dribbble&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Change of method..&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided here to go out and find a DailyUI challenge to help with ideas and concepts each day. I found myself either lacking on an idea or bouncing too much between them, wasting time I’d rather not waste. Enter &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyui.co/&quot;&gt;dailyui.co&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is really not so much a weekend build as a when-I-find-time build. It’ll be a running log of my overall thought process and the execution of creating an application with React Native.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Stay Hydrated, Friends&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s build a water tracking app. The focus is going to start with the front-end, user-oriented needs. So, what am I building:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I drink water, I want to track the amount to make sure I’m drinking a healthy amount throughout the day&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To accomplish this, the application will require features such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set a water intake goal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create new drink&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enter new drink amount&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enter previous drink amount&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Store a list of favorite beverage types and their water amount&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable Quick-Add of favorite beverages for fast entry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show a history of the water drank&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;History will clearly indicate when the daily goal was met&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow the user to edit, delete, and create entries for past drinks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Congratulate the user on consistently hitting their goal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sounds like a strong set-up for this app. This first version will be very minimal, allowing me to “grease the groove” with React Native, React, and maybe Redux. Okay, let’s talk overall architecture and structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want this to be as close to a single-point interaction as possible. The user should open the app, hit “Track Drink,” and close the app. Maybe a watch integration for these ultra-fast micro entries, but that’s what I’ll call scope creep — for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This single point interaction focus should help me to keep page count low. Our main screen should include all options required to quickly enter a new drink:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Auto-set to previous drink&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quick-select frequent drink type&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adjust amount drank&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change unit type&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save entry as new favorite drink with label&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select a favorite&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Submit drink&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A navigation should be present to expand the value of the application:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Main: Drink tracking screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;History: See how well you’re tracking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Favorites: Create and Edit favorite drink types&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Settings: Not required in this first version but may become a necessity in future if the development of this application is continued&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, let’s go make the interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weekend builds, but with a family and newborn responsibilities, are not weekend builds! I’m going to build this in a ship-as-fast-as-possible, but let’s drop the weekend need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, back to the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to give Figma a try for the prototype- and this is incredible. I’m still getting oriented to their interface, but this is quite possibly the perfect tool for fast prototyping. I’ve already become a big fan. They even offer embed code… let’s see what this is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
          &lt;div
            class=&quot;gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper&quot;
            style=&quot;padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 1.0725rem&quot;
          &gt;
            &lt;iframe style=&quot;
            position: absolute;
            top: 0;
            left: 0;
            width: 100%;
            height: 100%;
          &quot; src=&quot;https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Fproto%2Fb4mhtPcDaQ5F07AOohVK8O%2FMinMaxHydrate%3Fnode-id%3D6%253A6%26scaling%3Dscale-down&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;note: If you want to share your prototype, go to the prototype screen and share from there! You also get live updates. So if you want to lock in at a specific version, you may need to make a new document. The prototype shared here is updating as I create the interface.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am very impressed with Figma! The only thing I’m struggling with is the animations of the prototype. Some of these connections do not make sense, however it may be my bias towards other systems I’m already familiar with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Screens prototyped so far by Sunday night:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Main entry screen/card&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Entry history timeline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;History stats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope I can finish the interface tomorrow. It is a busy day, but I can tell how positive this practice of &lt;em&gt;greasing the groove&lt;/em&gt; is for me right now so I’ll make sure to find time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One small thing I wish Figma had: Export Frames as images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;11/30: Anyone with kids who can still pull off a weekend project.. kudos. Massive kudos. 🙌&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, the interface is at a point where I’m happy to start building. You should be able to see the interface in its most recent state above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, let’s go:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let’s make sure Expo is up to date. Also handy if you haven’t installed Expo for react native yet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot;&gt;
      &lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ npm install -g expo-cli&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more info, visit the official &lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started&quot;&gt;React Native docs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s start the project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot;&gt;
      &lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ expo init MinMaxHydrate&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided on the blank workflow with Yarn as my dependency tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot;&gt;
      &lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ cd MinMaxHydrate &amp;amp;&amp;amp; yarn start&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late addition to scope (our favorite!) of having teams in the mix. It’s a bold plan, let’s see if it plays out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have our foundation, let’s add some structure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;app&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;actions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;assets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fonts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;icons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;images&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;components&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;config&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;modules&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reducers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;store&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;views&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh and of course, we should be tracking with &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot;&gt;
      &lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;git init&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll keep the rest of the git steps out of this, but just a reminder for anyone who may follow this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this is a UI focused workflow at the moment, one of the first things I want to do is create a global stylesheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s create another directory under &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;assets&lt;/code&gt; called &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;styles&lt;/code&gt;. I’ll create &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;global.js&lt;/code&gt; within this directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going to structure this file into sections that will help to clarify the purpose of the styles. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot;&gt;
      &lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;import { StyleSheet } from &amp;#39;react-native&amp;#39;

const layout = StyleSheet.create({   
  container: {                       
    marginTop: 150,
    backgroundColor: &amp;#39;#ededed&amp;#39;,
    flexWrap: &amp;#39;wrap&amp;#39;
  }
})

const buttons = StyleSheet.create({  
  primary: {                         
    flex: 1,
    height: 70,
    backgroundColor: &amp;#39;red&amp;#39;,
    justifyContent: &amp;#39;center&amp;#39;,
    alignItems: &amp;#39;center&amp;#39;,
    marginLeft: 20,
    marginRight: 20
  }
})

export { layout, buttons }   &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, every style that assists in layout will be contained within the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;const layout&lt;/code&gt; and styles for buttons will be contained to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;const buttons&lt;/code&gt;. Repeat as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s move the contents of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; into a better location. This will be &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;/app/views/Main.js&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot;&gt;
      &lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js

import React from &amp;#39;react&amp;#39;;
import Main from &amp;#39;./app/views/Main&amp;#39;

export default function App() {
  return (
    &amp;lt;Main /&amp;gt;
  );
};&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot;&gt;
      &lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Main.js

import React from &amp;#39;react&amp;#39;;
import { Text, View } from &amp;#39;react-native&amp;#39;;

export default function Main() {
  return (
    &amp;lt;View&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;Text&amp;gt;Open up App.js to start working on your app!&amp;lt;/Text&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/View&amp;gt;
  );
};&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great! Everything in our simulator should be nearly identical to how it was before! This move is going to be useful when we begin to add state management and routing into the application. More on routing soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, back to the matter at hand, styles. Let’s start with colors. Keeping colors consistent throughout the UI is critical, let’s set up some variables to help us with this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot;&gt;
      &lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;global.js

const colors = {
    darkBlue: &amp;#39;#0A1C3F&amp;#39;,
    midBlue: &amp;#39;#227BCE&amp;#39;,
    brightBlue: &amp;#39;#59AFFF&amp;#39;,
    grayBlue: &amp;#39;#18294A&amp;#39;,
    yellow: &amp;#39;#E5D969&amp;#39;,
};

const layout = StyleSheet.create({   
  container: {                       
    backgroundColor: colors.brightBlue,
    flex: 1,
    flexWrap: &amp;#39;wrap&amp;#39;
  }
})&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hol’ up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t set out to make this a tutorial, but an example of my thought process and a record of me creating an application. This is going to be where jumps begin to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One jump is figuring out the swipe to show/hide the information behind the main entry form. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/rn-bottom-drawer&quot;&gt;This looks promising to solve this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;New Thing!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve never forked an NPM package to use in a custom way within a project, this is how to do just that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fork the original repo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove original package from project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt;, add the dependency with repo of your new package. For example, mine is now: &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;rn-bottom-drawer&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;https://github.com/brandonbrown/mmf-rn-bottom-drawer.git&amp;quot;,&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also ran &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ yarn add https://github.com/brandonbrown/mmf-rn-bottom-drawer.git&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; of the npm module I removed &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;react&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;react-native&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;devDependencies&lt;/code&gt; due to a name collision with libraries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;yarn&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;yarn start&lt;/code&gt; and we’re back in business with our own version of the module&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of that so I can control the width, but also not lose the work in the case I need to pull the project back down and reinstall the dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sliding&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s add the ability to swipe the stats behind the main form card. I’ll add this package to handle this: &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ yarn add react-native-swiper@nightly&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I quickly added the package to my &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Main.js&lt;/code&gt; to test if it brings the correct capabilities.. and it did. That was too easy. Should I be worried?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is how this file looks right now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot;&gt;
      &lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Main.js

import React from &amp;#39;react&amp;#39;;
import { Dimensions, StyleSheet, Text, View  } from &amp;#39;react-native&amp;#39;;
import { layout, buttons, card } from &amp;#39;../assets/styles/global&amp;#39;
import Card from &amp;#39;./Card&amp;#39;

import Swiper from &amp;#39;react-native-swiper&amp;#39;

export default function Main() {

  return (
    &amp;lt;View style={layout.container}&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;View style={layout.header}&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;Text&amp;gt;Profile&amp;lt;/Text&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;View style={layout.navigation}&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;Text&amp;gt;Teams&amp;lt;/Text&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;Text&amp;gt;Tracker&amp;lt;/Text&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;Text&amp;gt;Favorites&amp;lt;/Text&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;Text&amp;gt;Settings&amp;lt;/Text&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/View&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/View&amp;gt;

      &amp;lt;View style={layout.content}&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;Swiper
          style={styles.wrapper}
          loop={false}
          showsButtons={false}&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;View style={styles.slide1}&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;Text style={styles.text}&amp;gt;Hello Swiper&amp;lt;/Text&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;/View&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;View style={styles.slide2}&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;Text style={styles.text}&amp;gt;Beautiful&amp;lt;/Text&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;/View&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;View style={styles.slide3}&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;Text style={styles.text}&amp;gt;And simple&amp;lt;/Text&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;/View&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/Swiper&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/View&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;Card /&amp;gt;

    &amp;lt;/View&amp;gt;
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  wrapper: {},
  slide1: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: &amp;#39;center&amp;#39;,
    alignItems: &amp;#39;center&amp;#39;,
    backgroundColor: &amp;#39;#9DD6EB&amp;#39;
  },
  slide2: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: &amp;#39;center&amp;#39;,
    alignItems: &amp;#39;center&amp;#39;,
    backgroundColor: &amp;#39;#97CAE5&amp;#39;
  },
  slide3: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: &amp;#39;center&amp;#39;,
    alignItems: &amp;#39;center&amp;#39;,
    backgroundColor: &amp;#39;#92BBD9&amp;#39;
  },
  text: {
    color: &amp;#39;#fff&amp;#39;,
    fontSize: 30,
    fontWeight: &amp;#39;bold&amp;#39;
  }
})&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah that was &lt;em&gt;incredibly&lt;/em&gt; easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, onto something else. Let’s bring some charts into this. I’m a big fan of &lt;a href=&quot;https://formidable.com/open-source/victory/docs/victory-chart/&quot;&gt;Victory Charts&lt;/a&gt; and most likely will use them, but I’ll do a quick look to see if any new alternatives have shown up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This looks promising: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-chart-kit&quot;&gt;React Native Chart Kit&lt;/a&gt;
I really like the contribution graph, I may install this and see how far you can push it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ yarn add react-native-chart-kit&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ yarn add react-native-svg prop-types&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also needs a few adjustments to handle the styling I’m after. I also just learned that contributions don’t count in forks unless merged into the parent repo. I’d like to track my work, so &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/duplicating-a-repository&quot;&gt;duplicating the repo&lt;/a&gt; may be necessary. I may add the contributions into the parent in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, holding a new born slows the typing and the brain equally&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phew! Messing with SVGs directly is a bit of a steep learning curve- but now I can control the radius of the bar chart … bars … independently. Need to sync the project to my custom version of this package now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A snippet of what I just accomplished:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot;&gt;
      &lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;// barchart.js
...
const barX = paddingRight + (i * (width - paddingRight)) / data.length + barWidth / 2
      const barY = ((barHeight &amp;gt; 0 ? baseHeight - barHeight : baseHeight) / 4) * 3 + paddingTop
      const barTopRadius = this.props.chartConfig.topRadius
      console.log(`bar ${i} x: `, barX )
      console.log(`bar ${i} y: `, barY )
      return (
        &amp;lt;Path
          key={Math.random()}
          fill={this.props.chartConfig.color(1)}
          d={`
          M${barX},${barY}
          h${barWidth - barTopRadius}
          q${barTopRadius},0 ${barTopRadius}, ${barTopRadius}
          v${(Math.abs(barHeight) / 4) * 3}
          h${(barWidth) * -1}
          v${(Math.abs(barHeight) / 4) * -3}
          q0,-${barTopRadius} ${barTopRadius},-${barTopRadius}
          z`}
        /&amp;gt;
      )
...&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright! Customized repos so far if you’d like to take a look:
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/brandonbrown/mmf-react-native-chart-kit&quot;&gt;Custom react-native-chart-kit&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/brandonbrown/mmf-rn-bottom-drawer&quot;&gt;Custom rn-bottom-drawer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Chart Styles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow, these really kicked me for one today! Finally have them looking close to what my design was- but the implementation could be stronger. For now, moving on to other things and will revisit later. Don’t want to stop for the sake of tweaking things.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[BKMKS7]]></title><description><![CDATA[Development The Power of Serverless For Front-end Developers Oh Shit, Git!?!

Now I do admit that as the industry has grown and matured, it’s difficult not to bump into another pixel-worker in day-to-day life. Somehow, 90% of the people I’ve met in this industry have been incredible in some form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a palatable sense of friendliness, acceptance, motivation, and care that seems to be carried by most people in this industry. This feeling is one of my favorite parts of calling myself a web-worker. Seriously, most people in web rock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve started gathering a list of people I highly recommend paying attention to, getting to know, and to appreciate what they’ve done for all of their peers in the web industry. By no means is this the end-all be-all of web lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This list is going to include names such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chris Coyier&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sarah Parmenter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ethan Marcotte&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Denise Jacobs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wes Bos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NPJ&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jeffrey Zeldman&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chris Do&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;David Walsh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eric Meyer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rachel Andrew&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jen Simmons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brad Frost&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and so many more&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously folks, you’re all incredible. Thank you for everything you’ve done for our industry and all of those people you’ve helped grow to be the next generation of pixel-workers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Fast App]]></title><description><![CDATA[There is so much going on.

&lt;p&gt;I need to plan, build, and release a small app. I’ve had ideas piling up for years, but now it’s time to move. Responsibilities at my full-time job are growing, client deadlines are getting tighter, a partnership for another app is forming, and there’s a baby coming in October. There is so much going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What To Build&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m writing this to help me think this out. My gut says create a workout app. My version of the standard tracking app. A tracker that gets out of the way but keeps you moving in the right direction. I’ve had a multitude of versions and concepts, know the gotchas and the areas to improve on - and I’m trying to convince myself to not build this yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I’m trying to convince myself out of the workout space is to force a new idea to come out. Most likely, I’ll be building a workout app by the end of this writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m also planning a large app in the live-music space. This is going to be a huge undertaking in and of itself. Building something small this week to help me learn a few things or find my blind-spots in that app could be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also have to finish creating an app that ties into an e-commerce solution for a current, amazing client. I’m considering building this on a rails-api/react stack due to my comfort levels in these areas. The flexibility of an easy to adapt api back-end paired with the device-reach capabilities within the react ecosystem is a large contributor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to lay out my priorities to help make this decision:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The MVP should be deliverable within 1 week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web First in delivery, Mobile focused in use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subscription model, $5/month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I must see worth in the overall idea&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should have plenty of room for growth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Should it be MinMax?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health space has so many players because there is a space for everyone’s approach. I’ve been sitting on MinMax for so long, and I really want to see it through. I’ve been fighting more of an ethical battle over the future of the concept, but I think it’s time to jump in and do it. The ethical problems are a long reach. Concern over the use of the math and structures I’ve been developing for the concept are what I’m worried about, but I think this is my cynical mind taking over- but most likely my mind looking for a way to validate why I haven’t built this yet. Version 1 of MinMax may just have to be the most basic of work out apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Build In The Open&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, It’s going to be MinMax. Workout tracking with a leveling system, with plans to build workout planning to help leveling along with machine learning magic to help individual users down their own paths. 1-week to get to a working app, with another week most likely to get to shipped and at a level of payment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Studying the Human Body]]></title><description><![CDATA[The human body is far more incredible than I ever realized.

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example- I just learned that the heart wants to naturally beat about 100 times per minute. Your body actively slows this to what is your resting heart rate- 60 to 80 BPM for most people. Then as part of a response to stress does your body lower this slowing-signal and allow your heart to raise its beating pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forever, I’ve always thought that the resting heart rate was the baseline your body ran at. Instead, the body essentially ‘keeps some in the tank’ for quick reaction to outside stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which makes complete and total sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just these first few chapters have already made me confident that this studying is going to pay off in so many ways. I appreciate that the program I’m using, &lt;a href=&quot;https://acefitness.org&quot;&gt;ACE&lt;/a&gt;, has made it clear that Personal Training is far more than what many (myself included) must assume it to be. Trainers aren’t picking exercises or activities from a list and assigning them- they truly know the body and why it’s acting the way it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The level of information I’m being slammed with already is incredible. If anything, I can’t wait until I’m in a position where I can share this information in a meaningful and helpful way for the people around me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heart rate example above has already sparked some thoughts towards researching anxiety. Maybe there’s something about all of the systems that come together to raise heart rates and prepare your body for ‘fight or flight’ that is really the cause for many of the debilitating anxiety stories I’ve heard.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Athlean-X and Supporting The Honest Givers]]></title><description><![CDATA[I’m a big fan of constant learning.

I obsessively watch YouTube videos on a breath of topics, religiously listen to podcasts that go deep into areas I didn’t know could be so interesting, and I will do everything I can to support the people that make this all possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of what I write about is a self-targeted sense of improvement. My main focus at this time is a physical improvement. My body needs to regain a sense of proper functioning, giving it the ability to support other areas of my life. I wrote the other day about a World Cup inspired workout, but I decided to rethink my real goals. I need to form a strong base. One that targeted, functional programming can benefit off of. I went back to an old resource for fitness information, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe0TLA0EsQbE-MjuHXevj2A&quot;&gt;Jeff Cavaliere&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeff runs a Youtube Channel devoted to sharing information. He does sell programs, supplements, shirts, and other items at his website &lt;a href=&quot;https://athleanx.com&quot;&gt;https://athleanx.com&lt;/a&gt;. However, he himself has said you don’t need to buy his programs to be successful. He shares it all on his YouTube channel and does a great job of communicating in a way you can trust him. I went and purchased his Max Size 90-day program because of his honest, truthful, and giving approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day 1 is Monday, July 16 day 90 will be October 14. I’m going to share my experience and progress along the way both here and potentially in other places.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Coffee and Success]]></title><description><![CDATA[Mornings and I haven’t seen much of each other for the better part of a decade.

The only way I was getting up with the sun was to put in a round of 18 with my father and brothers at our favorite golf course. Living the 10 am to 3 am life had its perks, but that life has long passed. I’m still not an early riser by many standards, however, I’ve made the shift happen by using one simple trick: Be successful as soon as possible after waking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Don’t Consume, Create!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a plague silently befalling the modern connected world. It happens across the country each morning causing the loss of precious time to live: The Social Media scroll. Many mornings today start with a roll-over, checking the time on a phone, and then time-travel 10 minutes, 20 minutes, an hour into the future after falling into the black hole of social media. Then, starting the day after this mind-numbing, unbeneficial activity is slow, groggy, and probably rushed because your addiction to the scroll took your brain away from time-awareness and you’re late for everything. No wonder so many people hate mornings more than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing we should be consuming in the morning is breakfast, water,  and coffee. Let’s use that coffee addiction to trick ourselves into better mornings. Many people are already queuing up their favorite morning excuse “I can’t do anything before I have my coffee.” Well, bullshit. If you’re that dependant on coffee to get moving in the morning, there are other areas of your life that need fixing, it’s not the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can you do tomorrow morning that will take 5 minutes, maybe 10 minutes, that will earn you that coffee? Here’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/7-minute-workout/id650762525&quot;&gt;7-minute workout ios app&lt;/a&gt;. Run for 5 minutes in one direction, turn around and come back. Meditate. Journal or work on a small article. Work on that side-project you’ve been dreaming of for years. Don’t play video games, don’t read, don’t watch television, stay away from social media. You need to produce something of meaning. Something that will help you to feel accomplished before that perfect caffeinated elixir touches your lips. After a few days of this, you’ll own your mornings rather than your morning coffee owning you.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[World Cup Fitness Inspiration]]></title><description><![CDATA[The World Cup brings to my life an incredible joy every four years.

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Cup brings to my life an incredible joy every four years. It also offers an interesting moment to consider how life has changed over the last cycle of international play. During the 2014 games, I was single and living in a pool house with all the time in the world to exercise, cook full &amp;#x26; healthy meals for myself, and enjoy athletic activities at my leisure. This time I’m a bonus dad to three girls negotiating levels of cheese covered carbs, balancing schedules, and in serious lack of real competitive sporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s taken some time to adapt, but I’m finally finding ways to bring fitness back into this frenetic life. It’s taken strong efforts in prioritization, compromise, and a bit of creativity to find the moments and the right activities to regain a sense of fun fitness in my lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I Love the World Cup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014, I was the typical American soccer fan. I watched the world cup, tried to sound like I knew what I was talking about based on my time playing in High School, and used it as an excuse to throw mid-day, alcohol-fueled pool parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Dailey Blind sent in that long, high-curling ball to Robin Van Persie in full sprint. The diving header Robin played at the end of Blind’s pass was a vision of the incredible magic brought to the stage of World Cup play. Instantaneously, I fell back in love with this beautiful game. Thank you, Blind and Robin, for relighting my passion for the sport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last four years, I’ve been obsessed with Manchester United. Awkwardly, if you follow Premier League football, you’ll know this has been a tumultuous time in United’s history. For the better, my love of the club has only grown stronger season over clumsy season. I watched as Van Persie was pushed out when his form took a dip. I witnessed Shaw’s horrific leg injury put expectations on pause. Wayne Rooney, the face of modern United, became the all-time top scorer for the club and is now in the MLS with Schweinsteiger and Ibrahimovic. After all of this, I’m more passionate about the club and excited about its future than I have been for the past 4 years due to one big reason- Romelu Lukaku.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;World Cup 2018&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the Quarter Finals of the 2018 World Cup. Tournament favorites Brazil are playing to a raucous crowd, easily confusing the Russian stadium’s atmosphere for a home match. The opponents, Belgium, have been absorbing attack after attack and look to be running out of the barrels of luck keeping them in the match thus far. Belgium’s defense is fighting. They’re putting in top efforts, but being matched against Brazil’s forwards is going to push any team’s limits. Brazil has already had four clear chances on net and can only blame themselves for not having the points. Courtois has put in what may be his biggest career performance, absorbing Brazils every on-target effort. Belgium, however, has been using their firepower up top to scorching effect. Romelu Lukaku, Kevin de Bryune, and Eden Hazard are wreaking havoc on Brazil’s high defensive line. Later in the match, Brazil will find a way to deal with this strategy, but till then this is Lukaku’s show to run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lukaku has shown the world this tournament what many Manchester fans already know, he’s going to be one of the best to play the game. He will match the greats with goals and assists, but that’s not why he’s so inspiring to watch. It’s his unselfish, team-oriented, physical play that separates him from the pack. When Lukaku is on the ball this World Cup, you can feel the electricity in the air because something great is in the near future. The mentality, the physicality, the class, and the support he offers others makes him the ultimate athlete. He burns with a passion to win and will do the work to win. Sad that it’s become something of a joke to many United fans, but to watch as Lukaku celebrates his teammates’ goals with more fury than his own explains everything you need to know about this future Captain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Build Momentum with Mentality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t hold it against any defender if they confuse Lukaku for Juggernaught when he’s bearing down on them at full sprint. To have that speed and power of someone his size is a testament to his determined work ethic and drive to be the best. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theplayerstribune.com/en-us/articles/romelu-lukaku-ive-got-some-things-to-say&quot;&gt;Read this article at The Players Tribune&lt;/a&gt; to really understand Lukaku’s mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take this colossal motivation and do something with it. Fitness to me needs to have three things to be effective: Fun, Purpose, and Practicality. These, combined with the inspirational work ethic of Lukaku, make my baseline for deciding what action I’ll take in my fitness routines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Running is Boring&lt;/h3&gt;

        alt=&quot;Get Out and Play&quot;

      /&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hate it. Running is monotonous, bordering on torturous work. Explains why I played Keeper and Central Defense when I played. Knowing this, it’s high on my list of priorities. Endurance and sustained energy are two of the most practical indicators of fitness for myself. I don’t need to run a marathon, but I’d like to be able to handle sprints after an hour of high-effort play. I’m about to drop all of my motivation-through-design knowledge on myself and get myself to this goal. Here’s my plan for beating the tedium of running:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Play with the kids&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these kids won’t stop growing. At least now they’re big enough to kick the ball around! We spend 30-60 minutes every day playing and “practicing” now. If I can only fit one thing in each day, it’s this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stay Outside&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What sounds more boring than running for 10, 20, 30 minutes? Running staring at the same wall for 10, 20, 30 minutes. I’ve had to shift my sleep schedule to get my run in before the Florida heat and humidity settle in, but I have noticed many benefits to adding a morning run to the routine. Want to be run-friends on Nike Run Club? Send me a tweet and I’ll add you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Small-stepped goals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mile is just under 11 minutes currently. When I get 1 mile down to 9 minutes, I’ll start running 2. No need to run a marathon or even a 5k yet, aiming too high will only cause unnecessary frustrations, injury, and disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;HIIT and Soccer Drills&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has been my favorite addition yet. While I’m playing with the kids, I’ll set up “drills” for them, then take part myself, too. It keeps them energized, I get a workout in, and they’re starting to think of all this as play rather than a chore. Glad I held onto those cones from all those years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Power House&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I do love, is strength conditioning. In soccer, having the strength to hold off a pressing defender after sprinting up and down the pitch is an outstanding asset to have in your wheelhouse. There are countless variations of exercises to perform to build leg strength. You don’t need a gym, but I’ll be describing my routines which utilize my access to gym equipment. To warm up a lower body exercise, I’ll pick two or three of these lunge variations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jump Squats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standing Lunge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clock Lunge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Split Lunge Jump&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Walking Lunge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These lunges directly impact the leg muscles athletes need for strength, power, explosiveness, and injury resistance. Also, performing them properly will help to increase knee and leg joint health. My knees can use all the help they can get so after lunges, I’ll focus on knee health with a few of these movements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lying Leg Raises&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prone Straight Leg Raises&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supermans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lateral Lunge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wipers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that my legs know it’s time to work, I can move on to strength training. Leg day has always been my favorite within the standard workout routines because the options are so limitless, but the basics are powerful. A starting leg strength training day will typically follow this plan. Unlike the others, I’ll do everything on this list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Back or Front Squat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Romanian Deadlift&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bulgarian Split Squat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leg Press&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hip Thrust&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calf Raises&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jump Squats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re going to be running, pivoting, taking shots, sending long passes, holding defenders off, and pushing attackers off the ball you’re going to need the upper body strength to withstand all of this. Most importantly, your trunk, your abdominal and back muscles, need to be strong enough to effectively use your strength and resilient enough to keep your endurance levels high. Without this core strength, you’ll be working to keep your body upright, draining your energy and making you ineffective on the ball. I’ll add one or two of these on strength conditioning days or perform all on days out of the gym:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lying Leg Raises&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flat Plank&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Side Plank&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Walking Side Plank&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quadruped Opposite arm/leg&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Medicine Ball Overhead Throws&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Medicine Ball Side Throws&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seated Russian Medicine Ball Twist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To maintain a healthy balance, arms, shoulders, and chest should still be targetted. In addition to balance, increasing the strength in these areas will make your sprinting, body blocking, and even your shots more powerful. It’s important to understand that explosive strength comes from your entire body, not a single muscle group. These workouts are normally grouped into two routines based on pushing and pulling movements. One day for push, another day for pull:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Push&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flat Chest Press&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incline Dumbbell Press&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standing Military Press&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wide-Grip Upright Rows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dips&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lateral Raise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cable Pushdown&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Pull&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deadlift&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pull Ups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bent Over Rows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lat Pull-Down&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rear Delt Flye&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bicep Dumbbell Curl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cable Crunch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;All Together Now&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This type of training would work on a schedule such as this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Monday:&lt;/em&gt; Legs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tuesday:&lt;/em&gt; Outdoor training, trunk, and joint health&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wednesday:&lt;/em&gt; Push&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thursday:&lt;/em&gt; Outdoor training, trunk, and joint health&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Friday:&lt;/em&gt; Pull&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Saturday and Sunday:&lt;/em&gt; Active Rest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This schedule gives your body time to rest the areas you’ve worked while allowing you to stay active and consistent with your efforts. Don’t work through pain, don’t skip out on sleep and actual rest, and make sure to eat in a way that fits your energy requirements.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Design Your Life]]></title><description><![CDATA[Students are the best.

They teach us more about ourselves than we could have ever presumed they could. I’ve been repeating a simple commentary to many enthusiastic but quietly disheartened early designers for a decade when asked to critique their self-branding. “You are your toughest client.” Websites, logos, flyers, business cards, resumes, and apps. Anything they’re developing to show the world why they’re different and better than their professional competition. All the while thinking that this self-directed branding will be what shapes their careers for the next 40 years. It’s commonly an enjoyable, sometimes uncomfortable discussion, but obviously necessary to their growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discussion normally yields questions in the shape of “Who do you want to work with in the future,” “Where do you want to live and work in 10 years,” and “Why did you start down this career path” amongst other pointed directives. Yet, here I am, astonished at the fact I never considered to take the challenge of this thought process a giant step further: Why not design your life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Toughest Client You Will Ever Have&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working in an area of design for even a small amount of time, you will find that there are processes and guidelines for finding a solution or working with people that are not sure what they’re after. These standardized steps help to keep businesses moving efficiently and help to make the designer seem less like a magician and more like an architect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are different processes for various areas of design, diverse types of people and companies, and enough to fit a variety of timelines and budgets. A favorite of mine, which I’ve been fortunate to be able to research, teach, and employ for years is the Design Sprint. This process is what I’ll be working to implement directed and meaningful transformation in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Design Sprint’s power is wielded through two main factors: Iteration and Understanding. To use it effectively in the design profession, we rely on research and user interviews to attain understanding while creating disposable prototypes to allow for fast iteration. At its core, the entire design sprint follows a basic four-step process: Idea Generation, Prototype Creation, Testing, Analyze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before a designer picks a single color, sets a mood, or gets excited about a typeface they’ll get to use (this new version of my site was made for the sole purpose using IBM Plex, but I digress), they need to ask questions to know they’re solving the right problems. Good design is the understanding and application of meaningful, pointed research. Step one, Idea Generation, is intended to find these questions by cultivating wild thinking and inventive problem-solving. At this stage, it’s impossible to have a bad idea or a meaningless concept. Every inch of your creative-prowess should be brought to bear without room for doubt or self-defeating reason.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After an idea is organized enough to move forward, the next step is the creation of a disposable prototype. Disposable being the key action to focus on. We’re not looking for the best, nor do we need it. This step of the process is where we’ll save both time and energy by doing the absolute bare minimum that will achieve a meaningful result. For example, you want to create a new brand of cookies to sell in hip all-natural grocery stores. You need a factory to meet the demands of these stores, but you wouldn’t build the factory first. You would bake a small batch, give them away to a few people, and watch for and listen to their feedback. Now, rather than creating the factory and hiring the workers to make the wrong type of cookie, you can scale your idea up in a smart and efficient way. You may even find out you’ve been making terrible cookies but the best dog-biscuits the world’s happiest beings have ever enjoyed. Wouldn’t that be wonderful?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where Do We Start&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll save breaking down the Design Sprint in its entirety for another time. What’s important now is understanding how this style of thinking can help each of us to move forward in a satisfying, fulfilling, and productive way. What follows is my personal experience of moving through this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Starting Line&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get moving, I decided to sit and consider what I think my values are at this point in time. Asking this question offers me a place to start as well as a way to gauge how any changes have affected me over the course of time. To do this, I grabbed a journal and a pen and got to writing words I feel I stand for. Nothing neat, just a list written as it came to mind. None of these could be wrong, it didn’t matter if there were duplicates, synonyms, or antonyms, and I didn’t set a time-limit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only restrictions I gave myself for this process were when I performed it and that it had to be written, not typed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I purposefully waited until I was in a happy, productive, and optimistic mindset to write this list. As part of who I currently am, I fight bouts of depression and overall melancholy. Understanding this about myself was a critical piece to making this first step a success. The perfect time came to fruition when I was able to swing into a great new coffee shop riding the optimistic highs of a successful meeting with new clients about potential work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing these values down in a journal allowed for a large number of positives to contribute to the process. Keeping the computer closed meant no distractions, no unexpected social-media scroll pits, and the inability to delete. There is also a fat stack of research showing that writing causes deeper connections in memory and thought which clearly made it the right tool for this step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking this step alone was generously therapeutic. Having a clear understanding of how my present-day self considers himself was a strong cornerstone to lay. After a free-flowing, vanilla-caramel cold-brew fueled brainstorm, I decided to organize the list into five categories that seemed to be connections through the list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health&lt;/strong&gt;: Growth, Persistence, Doing, Vitality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Respect&lt;/strong&gt;: Timeliness, Discipline, Integrity, Accountability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creativity&lt;/strong&gt;: Adventure, Hope, Wonder, Courage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security&lt;/strong&gt;: Freedom, Strength, Control, Calm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fulfillment&lt;/strong&gt;: Family, Fun, Success, Service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Time to Dream&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my favorite part of practicing the design sprint. Letting the mind wander into the craziest futures unhindered by real-world practicality is reinvigorating to the once boundless optimism I carried. What dreams from the teenage years are still lingering? What am I missing out on in this world? What will my biggest regrets be? What type of lives am I capable of living? Who could be in my life? I can feel typing these questions has my subconscious going wild, causing a visceral feeling of hopefulness with a potential for untold amounts of joy and delight.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A future to fit what many of you would consider wild and unrealistic but always at the top of my list- rally driving. I’ve always loved the elements that rally driving has the ability to merge together. Traveling the world to see many of the most secluded, beautiful, emotionally engrossing areas humankind has the privilege to surround themselves within. The adrenaline-fueled, focused courage balanced by practiced skill and painstaking preparations. The sounds, smells, and trust of engineering contrasted by the solitude and merciless brutality of nature. The deep-bonded brotherhood between a driver, co-driver, and the engineers. Rally driving sounds like the most complete human experience possible in the modern world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ready, Steady, Go&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a pause here and begin the process. Make a plan for when and where you may be able to best reflect on yourself. You may thrive on the impulsiveness of trying this now, or you may require the same careful planning and considerations I did to ensure you’re doing this in the best way for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write one list: What do you value in the present, and what would you like to value in the future. Mix the two together. Don’t worry about what’s filling the page, just write it down if you think it truly matters to you. Write it down if you think it will positively shape who you want to become in the future. Write it down if it crossed your thought more than once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, within a week of creating this list write down the wildest versions of your future that you would fight to have true. There are no right or wrong answers here. Nothing too practical or unrealistic. Challenge yourself to dream up five versions of what your future can be, but if you can think of 50 that’s all the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This series of posts will be following my own experience throughout this process. I’ll be sharing my thoughts on employing design thinking to your life, the outcomes of each stage of the process, and the ways I think you can practice it for yourself. Staying true to the design sprint concept, there will be many ideas and concepts that are shared, tried, then ultimately discarded. This will force a lifestyle of new experiences, learned knowledge, and growth in character. Which, I suppose, makes it a guaranteed success.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[First Steps Towards Your Best Self Part 3- Eat]]></title><description><![CDATA[This is Part 3 of a small series on how to improve your life

&lt;p&gt;This is Part 3 of a small series on how to improve your life
with only a few small changes.
&lt;a href=&quot;../yourfirststeps-part1/&quot;&gt;Read Part 1-Sleep here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;../yourfirststeps-part2/&quot;&gt;Read Part 2-Move here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Diet is a Can of Gummy Worms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people will tell you to follow the diet they did last year because it’s so simple to follow and they saw incredible results. Then they’ll tell you that they’re about to start again because they put all the weight back on after stopping the diet last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that doesn’t sound like a healthy solution!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No More Diets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dieting is a bad idea. Dieting isn’t simple, if it were, we’d all be doing the same thing and looking like the perfect specimens of human evolution that we know we could be. If dieting were simple, entire multi-billion dollar industries wouldn’t exist. If we all knew how to eat and stay healthy, do you think there would be pizza delivery to every address in the United States? If we all knew how to consciously choose when to eat sugar, that checkout counters at every grocery store would be lined with sugar snacks? If we could all make these easy diet choices, would we need drugs for cholesterol, high-blood pressure, and all the other problems doctors and pharmacies love to prescribe for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dieting isn’t easy. Dieting is tough because many people see it as a short-term solution. “Six-pack abs in 2 weeks!” exclaims a tabloid cover at the checkout-aisle that you’re currently dropping a family-pack of Oreos, frozen pizzas, and a 2-liter of sugar-water on. Then after eating those Oreos and finishing off the pizza the kids didn’t eat, you decide it’s time to get back on your low-carb diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think About Your Food&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dieting isn’t going to get you to your goals. A healthy lifestyle that weighs the pros and cons of the food you eat, however, will. This is why I chose nutrition as the last topic of the basics to discuss with you. It’s the hardest to understand, the most difficult to follow, and the most guilt-inducing part of the puzzle for nearly everyone looking to make a healthier version of themselves. However, don’t beat yourself up over the Oreo’s. A healthy, nutrition-dense lifestyle is going to take time to develop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your nutrition isn’t as easy as what goes in is what comes out. Your nutrition is going to have physiological, timeliness, environmental, social variables, and more to consider. You think Keto sounds great until your friends order a pizza, then it’s your cheat day. You think Paleo sounds great until your friend makes a Peanut Butter and Jelly sandwich, then it’s your cheat day. Your co-workers want to celebrate after work with drinks, so you have a beer with them tonight— and again at the next celebration tomorrow. This is nothing but a cycle of guilt that you have no need to bear the weight of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Give Yourself a Break&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start simple. Make your home-life as food-temptation free as possible. Start with the easy targets: Cookies, cakes, snacks, sodas, frozen pizzas. When it’s your turn to grocery shop for the family, don’t bring home the cookies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your body is that incredible machine we keep talking about. Your brain doesn’t always control your choices, as powerful as you think your mind is. Thinking with your gut is being proven with a lot of powerful research to be more than a saying. Think about the logic for a second: You’ve been feeding your body sugar and other bad-nutrients for years, decades even, and is adapted in a way to run on that fuel. Suddenly, you’ve stopped giving your body the fuel it’s learned to run on. In response, your body powers up all of the cravings and addiction responses it can, trying to manipulate you (you read that right, you’re being unknowingly manipulated by yourself) into giving into the demands of the fuel it wants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve made it through the cravings, you’ll begin to remember what healthy is. Getting pizza at lunch no longer sounds appetizing. No longer are you pushing away guilt, but replacing that feeling with a sense of fulfillment as you know you’ve made a choice better for yourself— and still plenty delicious in the food options!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You go to the grocery store now and don’t even think to go down the cookie aisle. You visit the cereal aisle less- if only to get coffee because the grocery store knows one morning addiction will help to fuel the other. You visit the produce aisle more, you visit the butcher more, you don’t even consider the candy at checkout anymore. All of this from only the small step of not bringing bad food into your home. Next step is eating out and in social situations, but let’s not get ahead of the purpose of this series- the basics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basic Tactics for Better Nutrition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consistency: Stop dieting. Start making better choices that can last you a lifetime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Variety: Don’t always buy the same fruit, vegetables, and cuts of meat. Visit different stores. Their produce may be sourced from different regions of the world, giving you a small shift in the variety of nutrients that you otherwise may not be able to obtain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think outside the box: If it’s able to sit on a shelf, unrefrigerated, in a box, then think how long it will be able to stay inside your body. This doesn’t apply to everything but is a good basic rule to start thinking twice about the choices you’re making.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grow your own: Have space for a small garden? Reconnect with your food and grow your own veggies. You’ll learn something along the way, start to appreciate the health of your home-grown foods more, and know exactly what went into growing them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trust yourself, train your gut: If you go to pick anything up, and I mean anything, if your brain tells you no, put it back! Your instincts know what is good and what is bad for your body, make your gut listen to your brain. Some food may not taste that great, but you’ll find ways of cooking to improve it, or better yet- your body will learn what real, natural, nutrient-dense food tastes like and start craving these foods again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Start Simple&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For anything as important as your health, starting simple is the best foundation. You have one body, one chance. You don’t have to live a monk’s life but giving your body the best chances to operate the way it’s meant to will give you the best chances to live the life you want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t stress over your macros, don’t worry if your workout split is allowing enough recovery time, don’t get stuck in information paralysis. Fall back on the basics, on your natural foundations, and you’ll be set up to succeed brilliantly in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[First Steps Towards Your Best Self Part 2- Move]]></title><description><![CDATA[This is Part 2 of a small series on how to improve your life

&lt;p&gt;This is Part 2 of a small series on how to improve your life
with only a few small changes.
&lt;a href=&quot;../yourfirststeps-part1/&quot;&gt;Read Part 1-Sleep here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Get Up and Move&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you’re rested, it’s time to use all of that new found energy. Let’s take a look at where you most likely stand on the activity scale right now. Well, that’s odd, it says you’re sitting.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know that most Americans will walk less than 1 mile per day? Think about this, in roughly 16 hours of conscious time you have managed to not sit at a desk, in a car, or otherwise be stationary for more than 1 mile. Starting to see why your body doesn’t feel great?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving is what our bodies are made to do. Everything we have evolved to overcome and specialize in has been in the name of movement. In our modern culture, there isn’t the same impetus as chasing down your family’s next meal while carrying your world on your back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It Takes Moves to Solve Problems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of today’s health epidemics, such as obesity and diabetes, are being maximized by stationary lifestyles. Our body relies on movement as an indicator of what systems are necessary, and which can be turned off to allow for efficiencies in other areas. Use it or lose it is the basic rule our bodies run on. You sit all day and have no need to move other than walking to the corner store for lunch? Then let’s reduce the capacity of your lungs, heart, and cardiovascular system. We don’t need it! You don’t have a chance at running into some weird bug, getting cut by a sharp bush, or breaking an ankle on a run? Let’s lower the energy in your immune system, you’re safe right where you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Human body is incredible at adapting to the environment surrounding it. Look at how we’ve managed to spread around the world and stay relatively alike. Unlike every other member of the animal kingdom, we didn’t become full-blown specialists. We’re able to adapt, to be the best generalists the earth has ever seen and are thriving for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all need to move, your quality of life depends on it. We don’t all need to be athletes or feel the pressure to exercise that social media pushes on many of us. We just need to move. You don’t need a reason. You don’t need a goal. You only need to get moving. Get up and walk for 10 minutes, then come back to this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you feel? Re-energized? Accomplished? Maybe a little sweaty and sore? Fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try 15 minutes tomorrow and take note of how you feel after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Basic Tactics to get moving more:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consistency: Find a time in your day that you feel low on energy, usually reach for a sugar-filled snack or another cup of coffee. Before you think about taking a nap, go for that walk, do ten pushups, maybe find a yoga routine that can get you moving in ways you normally don’t. Whatever you do, stay consistent with your time. Your body is an amazing machine, but it’s also easy to trick. Instead of dreading the afternoon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t swing for the fences: Start small. Walk a mile before you run a mile. Do basic stretches before you jump into yoga. Stay above water before you start lapping the pool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build it in: Fit movement into your busy day. Many people skip the elevator and take the stairs. If you’re able, walk to the local coffee shop in the afternoon instead of reaching for your office or home-brewed cup. Take the kids outside and play a game of soccer with them, but actually play with them!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get addicted: After every session, no matter how hard, easy, or sweat inducing, tell yourself it was worth it. Mentally train your body to love movement. Be proud of your accomplishments, no matter how big or small they are. They’re your accomplishments to use as fuel to power the next. Your brain is magic, but it can still be tricked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hydrate: Drink your water, and lots of it. Don’t reach for sugar-filled juices and sports drinks. Straight, plain-ol’ water is the treat your body wants after any workout. However, there are many studies showing that your body craves minerals after losing them to sweat and energy creation for workouts, so grab some mineral water if you can!&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is learning how to better yourself really so complicated, that we need to cipher through millions of pieces of results? How do you even know that any of those articles, papers, blog posts, podcasts, or videos will be the right method for you to achieve your goals?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Splits, HIIT, keto, 3x8, push-pull, anabolic, CrossFit- what is all this? Guess you’ll need to pay an expert to help you get started. Maybe the gym down the road can help, but you don’t feel comfortable working out with others. Oh boy, there it is again: Where do you start?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Keep It Simple&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s nothing wrong with simple. Simple is effective, quick, understandable, and expandable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your health, fitness, and athletic abilities can all be managed, understood, and maximized within three basic pillars: Eat, Sleep, and Move. That’s it. Working to better those three areas is all it takes to level up your health. We’re not going to talk about a diet, we’re not going to talk about sleep patterns, we’re not going to talk about workout routines. All you need to get started is the knowledge that your body wants good nutrition, deep sleep, and to move how it has evolved to over 6 million years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;To Start, Sleep&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to improve your quality of life is to improve the quality of sleep in your life. If you’re waking up feeling groggy, requiring coffee to wake up, or feeling the fog finally lift hours after waking up- you’re in dire need of a sleep fix!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s my favorite thing to hear, and to be fair, my younger self was guilty of saying it, too: “I’ll sleep when I’m dead!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are enough hours in a day for you to get a good, restful sleep and still accomplish everything you can dream of. Sure, there are times in everyone’s life where sleep is sacrificed— You work two jobs, have kids, have a large responsibility to something or someone that cuts into your sleep, but why is it that sleep is the first thing we all think to sacrifice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep is the only chance your body has to properly restore, recover, and repair all of its necessary functions. This includes your mental capabilities, your physical growth, and your overall sense of well being. Proper deep sleep will improve all areas of your life, allowing you more potential growth than downing another can of sugar-filled, carbonated energy ever will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Basic Tactics for Better Sleep:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay consistent. It’s said to take 28 days to form a habit. Make yourself get in bed, ready to sleep, at the same time every night and your body will respond by giving you better and more effective sleep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cut caffeine and other uppers out up to 5 hours before sleep. In fact, try to reduce your caffeine intake overall and watch your energy levels increase!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dark and Cold will make you sleep long and deep. Think back to the environments our early ancestors evolved through. Before clothes, shelters, and even fire, our bodies responded to the dark and cold of the night by sleeping. Use this evolutionary left-over to trigger a natural deep sleep cycle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a night-time routine. You have enough time to stress about your day to day work and all the other things life can throw your way. Create a routine that can calm your mind and tell your body it’s time to rest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Declutter. Make your bedroom a sleep sanctuary. Build yourself a hibernation fortress and you will sleep incredibly. Keep your room free of stress reminders such as dirty laundry, used cups, and work-day items. Some people go as far as to remove stressful talk from the bedroom to have nothing but positive and restful associations with their sleep space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sleep is Everything&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without getting control of your sleep, you’re going to be pushing uphill against the weight of low performance across all areas of life. You can’t eat your way out of bad sleep, you can’t run yourself back from bad sleep. Get the rest your body needs and you’ll see improvements across the board. Stress management, sustained energy, increased vitality, muscle growth, and injury prevention all start while you’re asleep. Take your first step towards better health with a good night’s sleep.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
