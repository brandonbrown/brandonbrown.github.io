I love building new things- which means there’s a lot to do in the development world. Sometimes I go in too much on the development which has the effect of my design work falling by the wayside- maybe becoming dull.</p>\n<p>So, to help keep these skills sharp I’ll be partaking in a daily design challenge. Not UI, not UX, not logos.. everything.</p>\n<p>The reason I enjoy, and am thankful for, this industry I’m so privileged to be a part of is the breadth of work we’re able to be a part of. Bouncing from strategy to development to making something as beautiful as it is usable is something not many work-types offer.</p>\n<p>So, here come the designs. Today is the third, so I’ll be pumping out a few today. Everything that I’ll be sharing is practice and not oriented towards achieving any business goals. I haven’t designed for fun in a long time- this is going to be great.</p>\n<p>Something I’m going to experiment with are setting some type of constraints. The easiest will be color, I’ll use <a href="https://coolors.co/">coolors</a> to generate random colors which I’ll treat as “brand guides” I would normally not have control over.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Warm Up: <strong>Profile for a Golf Score Tracker with live updates and video/photo sharing for social interaction and honesty. <a href="https://coolors.co/4e0250-801a86-645986-8fe388-58bc82">Color scheme</a> <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/8808609-UI-Practice-1">See it on Dribbble</a></strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/8808609-UI-Practice-1" className="imagelink">[<img src="https://cdn.dribbble.com/users/32047/screenshots/8808609/media/95b3937bd9d8956ea90413d7d7b5021f.png" alt="December Daily Design 1"></a></p>\n<h5>Change of method..</h5>\n<p>I decided here to go out and find a DailyUI challenge to help with ideas and concepts each day.
