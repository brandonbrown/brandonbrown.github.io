I'm a big fan of constant learning. I obsessively watch YouTube videos on a breath of topics, religiously listen to podcasts that go deep into areas I didn't know could be so interesting, and I will do everything I can to support the people that make this all possible.

Much of what I write about is a self-targeted sense of improvement. My main focus at this time is a physical improvement. My body needs to regain a sense of proper functioning, giving it the ability to support other areas of my life. I wrote the other day about a World Cup inspired workout, but I decided to rethink my real goals. I need to form a strong base. One that targeted, functional programming can benefit off of. I went back to an old resource for fitness information, [Jeff Cavaliere](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe0TLA0EsQbE-MjuHXevj2A).

Jeff runs a Youtube Channel devoted to sharing information. He does sell programs, supplements, shirts, and other items at his website [https://athleanx.com](https://athleanx.com). However, he himself has said you don't need to buy his programs to be successful. He shares it all on his YouTube channel and does a great job of communicating in a way you can trust him. I went and purchased his Max Size 90-day program because of his honest, truthful, and giving approach.

Day 1 is Monday, July 16 day 90 will be October 14. I'm going to share my experience and progress along the way both here and potentially in other places.
