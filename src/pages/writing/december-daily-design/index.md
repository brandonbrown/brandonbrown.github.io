#Much Code, Wow Design
It's important to keep all of your skills sharp- especially the ones you're most passionate about. I love building new things- which means there's a lot to do in the development world. Sometimes I go in too much on the development which has the effect of my design work falling by the wayside- maybe becoming dull.

So, to help keep these skills sharp I'll be partaking in a daily design challenge. Not UI, not UX, not logos.. everything.

The reason I enjoy, and am thankful for, this industry I'm so privileged to be a part of is the breadth of work we're able to be a part of. Bouncing from strategy to development to making something as beautiful as it is usable is something not many work-types offer.

So, here come the designs. Today is the third, so I'll be pumping out a few today. Everything that I'll be sharing is practice and not oriented towards achieving any business goals. I haven't designed for fun in a long time- this is going to be great.

Something I'm going to experiment with are setting some type of constraints. The easiest will be color, I'll use [coolors](https://coolors.co/) to generate random colors which I'll treat as "brand guides" I would normally not have control over.

#####Change of method..

I decided here to go out and find a DailyUI challenge to help with ideas and concepts each day. I found myself either lacking on an idea or bouncing too much between them, wasting time I'd rather not waste. Enter [dailyui.co](https://www.dailyui.co/).
