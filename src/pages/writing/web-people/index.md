The web industry has a reputation for attracting, and sometimes cultivating, people who would find themselves at the fringes of the normal world. Now I do admit that as the industry has grown and matured, it's difficult not to bump into another pixel-worker in day-to-day life. Somehow, 90% of the people I've met in this industry have been incredible in some form.

There's a palatable sense of friendliness, acceptance, motivation, and care that seems to be carried by most people in this industry. This feeling is one of my favorite parts of calling myself a web-worker. Seriously, most people in web rock.

I've started gathering a list of people I highly recommend paying attention to, getting to know, and to appreciate what they've done for all of their peers in the web industry. By no means is this the end-all be-all of web lists.

This list is going to include names such as:
- Chris Coyier
- Sarah Parmenter
- Ethan Marcotte
- Denise Jacobs
- Wes Bos
- NPJ
- Jeffrey Zeldman
- Chris Do
- David Walsh
- Eric Meyer
- Rachel Andrew
- Jen Simmons
- Brad Frost
- **and so many more**

Seriously folks, you're all incredible. Thank you for everything you've done for our industry and all of those people you've helped grow to be the next generation of pixel-workers.
