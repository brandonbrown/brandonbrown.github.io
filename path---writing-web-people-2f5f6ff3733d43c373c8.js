Somehow, 90% of the people I’ve met in this industry have been incredible in some form.</p>\n<p>There’s a palatable sense of friendliness, acceptance, motivation, and care that seems to be carried by most people in this industry.

By no means is this the end-all be-all of web lists.</p>\n<p>This list is going to include names such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Chris Coyier</li>\n<li>Sarah Parmenter</li>\n<li>Ethan Marcotte</li>\n<li>Denise Jacobs</li>\n<li>Wes Bos</li>\n<li>NPJ</li>\n<li>Jeffrey Zeldman</li>\n<li>Chris Do</li>\n<li>David Walsh</li>\n<li>Eric Meyer</li>\n<li>Rachel Andrew</li>\n<li>Jen Simmons</li>\n<li>Brad Frost</li>\n<li><strong>and so many more</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Seriously folks, you’re all incredible.
